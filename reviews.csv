Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The dinner was a private, romantic birthday dinner for my wife and the staff and the food did not disappoint. Cozy table by the window overlooking the Eiffel Tower was awesome! Waiter was excellent and also volunteered to be our photographer. Food was delicious. My wife love it!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great place for food and drinks . Staff are super friendly. Amazing time !!! Thank you
Caf√© de l'Homme,2.0,2,2,2,2,"Llegamos y la cocina estaba cerrada y nos sacaron a las 2 horas
Precio calidad no se justifica"
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,3,2,4,"The food and service were both okay. The view of the Eiffel Tower was amazing. All went well throughout our experience until the end when our server brought our check to us. Upon handing over the bill, he knelt down to interrupt our conversation and told my husband and I ‚Äúthis is the bill and it is customary to add a ten to twenty percent tip onto this total.‚Äù It became very awkward and this point and we politely said ‚Äúokay‚Äù and continued our conversation at the table. He then interuppted us again and asked ‚Äúso do you want to add a tip?‚Äù. My husband looked up and said ‚ÄúNo. I do not.‚Äù The waiter then announced for the table to hear ‚Äúok, no tip for this time‚Äù, typed in the final total on his hand held device and hastily handed over the receipt after it printed out. For a restaurant that charges on average $70 per person to eat there, this should not have happened. We felt singled out because we were American. Would this waiter have walked up to a table full of French people and requested a tip? I think not, since it is NOT customary to tip in France. Would not recommend this restaurant if you‚Äôre American."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,This place is magic! Food is outstanding and the staff are fantastic. To top it off you have the most gorgeous view of the Eiffel Tower.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great place to eat, staff where amazing to us, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was amazing."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,3,5,5,The cafe offers a superb view of the Eiffel Tower. I booked a table for 3 pm and was disappointed as the kitchen closed at that time. We had dessert and drinks which was a satisfactory compromise. I have a magnificent photograph of my daughter and I beside the Iron Lady so I will cherish that. ü©∑
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excelente, comida, servicio, lugar, la vista !!! Todo muy bien. Costo? Considero un poco alto pero por el lugar,  la vista y calidad de los alimentos , lo amerita."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The staff was phenomenal ‚Äî friendly, welcoming and went out of their way to make us feel at home! The food was delicious and filling! We had a wonderful time in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Ha sido una experiencia incre√≠ble ha superado todas mis expectativas, la comida es maravillosa el servicio de parte de los camareros y recepci√≥n no pod√≠a ser mejor, el equilibrio calidad/ precio puedo decir que tambi√©n est√° bien porque es una experiencia m√°s interesante."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Incredible staff, fantastic service and views sat outside on the terrace. They even offered to heat up our pasta!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, superb view, excellent service. Absolutely would recommend! Skip the steak. Everything else is good."
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,1,We arrived at the restaurant to be told that they had no knowledge of our booking and they were closed for a private party!
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Tout √©tait bon comme d‚Äôhabitude . C‚Äôest toujours une bonne id√©e avec la magnifique vue
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent views of the Eiffel Tower. Staff were extremely polite. Cuisine was marvellous.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Perfect location for a view of the eiffel tower from inside the restuaeant, on the patio or outside while you wait for your reso. Ambience inside is romantic. Patio outside is superb. Also place outside to view eiffel head on."
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,1,"We were absolutely appalled when we arrived after an hour commute to the restaurant to be told or rather shouted at by two extremely rude security men that the restaurant was closed for a private function. They told us there was no manager working that we could speak to which could simply not be true. So at 9:30pm we were left with no restaurant to eat, even after going to the trouble of ringing the restaurant during the day to ask if there was a table which we were told there was, and then booking through open table as advised by the restaurant. What only heightened our disgust and dissatisfaction was the manner in which we were spoken to be security with one shouting at us ‚ÄúI will smash your face‚Äù . All of which was recorded on video. Overall a terrible experience and one I will most definitely share with others planning a trip to Paris."
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,1,Seated inside. $50 per person to sit outside. Found out when we arrived. Truffle fries were soggy drenched in oil. Drink glasses smelled horrible.
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,5,4,4,"Beautiful location, good food and vibes overall. We danced until they closed in front of the eiffel tower. What a treat! However was disappointed that the eiffel tower lights turned off 5 minutes after we sat down and that was the main thing we paid for. Apparently it closed an hour early in honor of the Israel, which is understandable and respectable, and something the restaurant doesn‚Äôt have control over.

Another issue- we almost weren‚Äôt allowed in due to ‚Äúdress code‚Äù. We were dressed nicely, nothing over the top fancy but we were wearing a long gold skirt and a black dress, no reason to get dress coded at a restaurant. Eventually he let us in after I already told him I paid $100 on opentable to just sit at the restaurant. (We paid another $180 for our meal)

Anyway, it was a great experience overall and I can‚Äôt complain too much. The staff was super cool other than the bouncer guy. But the experience could have been better due to the things i mentioned."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,This place was excellent especially for a last minute reservation since my original plans were canceled!
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Very tasty cuisine with a fantastic view. Thank you to American Express for helping me book.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Really nice, great view of the Eiffel Tower. Good food"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,le service est parfait et nous avions bien diner avec une belle vue
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excelente la ubicaci√≥n la comida la atenci√≥n el precio caro pero lo vale es la segunda vez que voy
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Overall it was a very wonderful experience. However, you need to be more specific in your advertising about the 50 Euros per person to sit on the Terrace and what it includes.
We were very surprised to learn that the cost of our food was on top of the 100 Euros per couple to sit on your Terrace. Yes, the view was spectacular, but you really should explain that the cost of the meal is not included!!!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,1,2,5,They gave me a 3:30 reservation and at 4:00 they closed the kitchen. I specifically said it was a birthday and I got nothing to show my friend. So embarrassed. Please and confirm they have food before you go there.
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,1,WARNING: Infants NOT admitted- although OpenTable clearly says otherwise.  RUDE AND THEY HATE CHILDREN. DO NOT ADVISE
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing food and unforgettable view , staff very friendly and welcoming"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing views, amazing food, amazing service!! What more could you ask for!!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,1,Don‚Äôt trust open table for booking here. It lets you book for lunch even though they don‚Äôt open for lunch. And for dinner they might just not honor or even tell you that there is a private event. I had dinner reservations and they didn‚Äôt sit me.
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Estaba cerrado, abren a las 7 y me dejaron reservar a las 5"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great view and experience. Left my vape and they ‚Äúthrew it away‚Äù üòâüòÇ
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,2,1,2,"Terrible service. Waiter charged a 35 percent service fee on top of the cost of food.
He threw away the itemized receipt. He brought a crumpled up receipt.
We checked the bill and realized we were overcharged.
He then gave us cash back for the service charge.
It was a terrible experience

Will never return"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Everything was exceptional, the Food, Service, Ambience. They played music that I loved. The people were nice, the staff was great. I give this place a 100/10. When I visit Paris again, I would def come back here"
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,2,3,2,"They charge you 50 each if you want to seat in the terrace with a view of the Eiffel Tower, thats about all they have a view, everything else is not worth it!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Tr√®s bon restaurant avec une vue magnifique sur la Tour Eiffel. Serveur sympathique et aux petits soins. La cuisine est tr√®s bonne. Nous reviendrons lors d‚Äôun autre s√©jour √† Paris.
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,5,3,4,fantastic views of tower Eiffel! No kid's menu but children loved French fries.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Best romantic place for a romantic date in Paris.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Was great experience, good service and amazing food"
Caf√© de l'Homme,2.0,2,3,3,4,"There is a dress code that is not mentioned on open table. Apparently men are not allowed to wear shorts, that said my son had to go back to the hotel, which was a 40 minute round-trip to change from shorts to pants. What is most disconcerting is that two other male patrons entered the restaurant wearing shorts while we were dining. Obviously a double standard. When we complained to one of the managers about this slight, she did apologize profusely and offered us a free dessert. At least the dessert paid for half of the Uber rides my son had to pay for. The $50 dollars per person extra surcharge to sit on the patio to view the Eiffel Tower is obstructed by a very large statue on the patio. The food was mediocre at best. I‚Äôve had better at other much cheaper French cafes. ÔøºService was typical French slow, but we had to ask for mineral water and more champagne many times before it finally arrived. One surprise is that when my wife mentioned she was cold, they brought her a very nice blanket. The one and a half hour time limit to sit on the patio isn‚Äôt really enforced Ôøº as I saw many patrons dine outdoors for two hours or more including my table. Overall, I think you can find other French restaurants which are worth your time. I personally would cross this off my list and wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to my worst enemy. Ôøº"

Merci √† tous!"

Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,1,Got there and restaurant was closed for renovations. Open table should not be accepting reservations for this restaurant
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Very beautiful best diner I‚Äôve had in France by far
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,3,5,5,Experience was amazing-including the service! The food was good not great but the location made up for anything the food lacked.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Perfecta no creo exista un mejor lugar en Paris para cenar disfrutando la imponente torre y sus luces .
Me encanto"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wonderful staff and excellent food. We had our three kids with us and they took great care of us all. The view is unmatched. All of the food was excellent.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Front row location to observe the Eiffel Tower.  The terrace has an ultra lounge vibe and dim light ambiance‚Äôs. At 11pm, when the tower lights began to sparkle, there is no better place.

I had the truffle pasta and my wife enjoyed the beef tenderloin.  Excellent place to enjoy a bottle of wine or champagne.   Have your camera handy!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Staff was incredibly rude, after having a reservation they informed us upon arrival it was 50 per person to sit on the terrace. The man rudely stated in the reservation it states that, which it did not. I had two children with me so why would I pay that for a glass of champagne and outdoors when I was going to pay to eat. However directly next door they have a wonderful restaurant Girafe with exceptional people and free outdoor seating with the same view."
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,3,4,5,Extremely well placed but food portions too small and very expensive for just a view on the Eiffel Tower
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,4,1,"Great food. Great view. Tables are extremely close to each other.
I brought my kids and Unfortunately the table next to us kept smoking and made my kids sick.
I wish there was more room or they could have put us in one of the alone tables for better experience. Bill was over $500.00 but only thing we would change would be table placement."

Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"an absolute must if ur visiting Paris!! Incredible views, food, service!!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I had a fabulous experience there for dinner last night while traveling solo and wanted a special experience. Can‚Äôt speak highly enough about the service, wine and food. Two things to know: 1 if you want the fantastic terrace view seating, there is a ‚Ç¨50 charge (includes champagne) AND 2 regardless of what open table says, you need to CALL the restaurant to confirm your reservation and seating request. I did this and had no issues and reiterate a great experience. I even got to compliment the head chefs when they came out to thank me for dining. Two other notes: the DJ gets fairly loud the later it gets and pay attention to sunset times if you want to see the tower sparkle‚Ä¶my 8:30pm rez in July was not late enough for the full effect (first twinkle at 11pm) can‚Äôt wait to go back on my next visit!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Best view at terrace for efil tower

Caf√© de l'Homme,2.0,2,2,1,5,"It is a spectacular view. Do not plan to eat there. Expect that the hostess will tell you you failed to book the open table booking properly, but know I know you did! I would not recommend open table permits them to use their service. They are not to be trusted. Food adequate. View spectacular. Just have a glass of wine, enjoy the Eiffel Tower, and don‚Äôt add on a tip"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great food, view and overall experience. Highly recommend!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I was really impressed.  As a wine professional, I eat and drink at fancy venues all over the world.... Cafe de L'Homme should pat themselves on the back... a great experience.  

First - the wines we carefully selected and there were both some nice referrences and a bunch of good wines and very reasonsable prices... I loved my J.M.  Boillot Montagny 1er Cru 2020 - around 95 Euro... it was fantastic.  The 2012 Chateau Carbonnier blanc was awesome with the carpaccio and the richer dishes we had.  

The menu is well designed - with a great selection of items. 

The venue is beautiful and both the management and the floor staff have great enthusiasm and customer service.   

I was also able to get a table last minute but I don't think that will happen next time - this place is sensational....

Great Job - 5 stars"
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Cannot even rate because the day we booked, June 21st, the restaurant was holding a private event but did not contact us at any point to let us know that we could not attend our reservation. We booked this reservation over a month in advance and when we arrived at the door, a very rude security informed us that a private event was being held and that our reservation was void. Thankfully another lovely restaurant in the area provided amazing service and food."
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,2,1,2,DO NOT PAY FOR THE EXPERIENCE. They will tell you the outdoor patio is closed and then begin to seat others outside saying they paid more than you. When we went we were surrounded by the rest of the American tourists that were told the patio was closed even though we all paid to sit outside while they sat locals outside. Avoid at all costs. Not worth the money. Much better food at much better prices with amazing views all over Paris.
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,5,"Was looking forward to this so much on my trip to Paris. It‚Äôs a beautiful restaurant/view. I made a reservation long in advance, confirmed via email 24 hrs before. I showed up, and it was closed for a private party. They were apologetic, but why didn‚Äôt they call or text to let me know?? Big letdown as all of the other rooftops in the area had no reservations left."
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,4,"Just left this restaurant‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt like to write reviews but I just had to for this place. Yes the view is beautiful but that‚Äôs where it stops. The waiter was incredibly rude like WOW. I‚Äôve never experienced that in my life. Literally was arguing with us when he got my mother in laws order wrong. They made us do a prix menu because we were a party of eight. All the food was terrible. I‚Äôve never had such bad risotto in my life. It had no flavor and just full of green beans. That was it! I don‚Äôt even think it had cheese at all either. It was really expensive for the food choices and on top of that, they make you pay an extra $50 per person to sit outside. That‚Äôs crazy. Definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant to anyone ever! Hope this helps someone learn from our mistakes."
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,4,4,5,"The view is amazing, beautiful setting. Was a great family place for a Sunday afternoon"
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,4,5,4,"Just like others, who reviewed, we received a number of emails and calls to not only confirm the reservation but also to confirm that we reserved Terrace seating. We of course confirmed and appreciated the follow-ups. When we arrived we were told that we did not make reservations for the Terrace when we booked. We started to remind them about the multiple confirmation emails and calls, but then decided it wasn‚Äôt worth the hassle and we sat inside.

Our waitress was super pleasant and we genuinely enjoyed her skillful hospitality. Unfortunately, we cannot say the same for all the staff members, including a rather rude Terrace manager. We politely asked our waitress if it was possible to take photos outside on the Terrace, and she immediately recommended the most advantageous angle. We walked out onto the Terrace and were immediately stopped by the Terrace manager who told us that we are not able to take pictures at the recommended angle. We did not protest and left the restaurant after settling our bill.

Food was okay, but nothing special. Save your money and engage a photographer for a personal photo shoot."
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Open table and this restaurant are not communicating. We had a table booked and confirmed on open table, arrived at the restaurant and it wasn‚Äôt even open for 2 more hours and had no booking for us at all. Restaurant even admitted that they have this issue regularly with open table.  Both the restaurant and Open table need to sort it out.
Awful way to treat customers."
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,1,They were closed. I should have known when so many people mentioned issues with bookings that it was not worth the time.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,4,3,3,Wonderful view and great food! The atmosphere was amazing and great service. We will come again next time we are in Paris. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"This place has an amazing view. The food is good, the service is a little slow which we did not mind because we were there for the experience. We where there at 8 pm and stay till 10:30 or so and saw the lights come on at the Eiffel Tower. They had live music and we had an awesome night!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Do not go here,
Firstly they couldn‚Äôt find are reservation even tho we booked weeks in advance and replied to the numerous message they sent to confirm which triggered off the continuous hostile environment it is,
The tables are so close together you might aswell be sitting on one continuous table, no privacy or relaxation - which caused the accident of a split drink on the floor and then manager or whatever he was ,was standing there giving dirty looks talking in french then came over and complained of how much the floor cost? Then said it wasnt he fault the drink split and then continued to spray whatever the cleaning product it was right next to us as we was eating, which he ended up spraying on my shoe , then suggested I deliberately put my foot in it? Why would I do that, 
Food was awful 
Service was awful
How they got the cheek to call that a high class restaurant is beyond me, 
Would highly recommend noone to go here,"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Gorgeous view and delicious food. I think the terrace charge was worth it. Overall, this was a great experience and would recommend it anybody."
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,4,4,"The steak was dry
Don‚Äôt order the tuna belly
But the ambience and service were good"
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,1,Made a reservation on this app for a Monday and the restaurant is closed on Mondays. I hope I will not get charged.
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,3,3,3,"Lindo lugar, lo mejor, las vistas a la Torre Eiffel, poder estar en la terraza en un d√≠a soledades privilegiado"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,They were great at acknowledging our special occasion. Offered us one of the best views from the restaurant. We actually had a choice between two tables. The view is truly amazing. The food was all perfectly prepared to savor all the intended chef intentions.
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,3,1,1,"Disappointing... As a formal wine country resident, I've been a lot of semi-formal  no course meal required. I asked them for the better seat, and they told me I can have 110 euro meal seat. So I said yes. Well, it did not worth to pay a penny more for that spot. You will see why from my pics. The next problem is service. When my mom and I were hesitating to have course meal table, because of the view. I could tell one server was very annoyed. He said ""Madame, oh please, please"" What do you expect from me? when I could not get the table which I requested 5 days ahead, and confirmed 3 days ahead. Plus, when I pay more than $100, I don't expect servers to kick my chair while they are serving me. Also  my server started taking food away from me without asking. ""Well"" he asked, but his hand was on my plate already when he asked.
I honestly did not believe all the bad reviews. But here I am. People, PLEASE DON'T GO. SAVE YOUR $$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,3,2,2,"The view outside of the Eiffel Tower was of course spectacular: and so close! My boyfriend ""popped the question"" that evening, and it was an unforgettable evening for us. However: the food was not adjusted to the environment: the potato flakes blew off the plates, and glasses broke around us continuously as the location can be windy and there were no wind breakers. There were heaters but it was nonetheless a bit of a challenge. We are adventurous people and appreciated the view of the Eiffel Tower, so we could not be persuaded to move back indoors for shelter. The interior of the restaurant was OK, but no view of the Eiffel Tower from inside sadly. Also: the staff was rather chaotic, we were not confident that they had things under control. And upon request to take pictures of us/film us on that unique moment of getting engaged...ALL photos were blurry and ruined....waiter: please make sure you know how to use a phone. The food was nice, but could be improved (ratio of bread and gooseliver pate, potato flakes when it's very windy outside, the food was cooled off in no time, etc.). However,this was our special night and the decor was very spectacular and overall the staff were friendly and obliging and doing their best to give us a special experience. We can laugh about it still, and will never forget this special evening for us."
Caf√© de l'Homme,2.0,2,5,1,3,"i specifically asked for a table in front of the eiffel tower, and the waitress/lady who took care of coats and reservations didn‚Äôt even care to see if there was any table available (the restaurant was empty), said she didn‚Äôt care about my reasons and that the table i was the one and if we didn‚Äôt want it, we could leave."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Good meal! Too cold for the terrace, but we saw the lights from a screen!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,This was my birthday dinner in Paris and it was the best experience (view + energy + ambiance) that I‚Äôve ever had for a birthday dinner. I would recommend this place 10x over for any and every occasion.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,4,What an amazing view!! My salmon was cooked perfectly and my fianc√©‚Äôs beef medallions were just right.
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,2,4,5,"In short, this is a great restaurant if you‚Äôre looking for a perfect view of the tower, nice ambiance, and well dressed restaurant-goers. The ambiance and the view were excellent. The food was good, but better food could be found for a better price elsewhere. So it depends on what you are looking for. I visited with my girlfriend and we had a perfect romantic dinner, and we are tourists so the view and ambiance was what we came for. But if you‚Äôre looking for a mind-blowing culinary experience, you might be better off elsewhere."
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,3,5,5,"Amazing view. Service is amazing 
Food was average. Would have expected much better for the prices"
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,1,We sat there for half hour and never got served. So we got up and left.
Caf√© de l'Homme,2.0,2,3,1,5,"Great localization, great view. Terrible service, average food. Overpriced wine menu"
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,5,4,5,"Cold outside, heat lamps helped but could be warmer / more of them! Clearly the best view possible, so not that big of a concern given time of year (end of December). Food was quite good, not Le Bernardin but several of the courses superlative in my opinion. Prix fixe was reasonable for quality of food and views."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Padre experiencia
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Absolutely worth every euro! The best view of the Eiffel Tower, the friendliest staff, and delicious food! Would definitely go back if I ever go to Paris again. 10/10 would reccomend!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,3,5,5,"Amazing view of the Eiffel Tower! Seated outside at Cafe de L'homme, heaters all round, most seats have the Eiffel Tower in view. Situated on Trocedero. Food was really nice! One of the best burrata I have had, mac and cheese with Truffle for mains also tasted great! Excellent service from the staff, all friendly and helpful."
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,4,1,3,"The lady receptionist was unprofessional, she didn‚Äôt serve us properly and when we ask for a table near the view she said this what he have and neglected us after that!!!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,A must in Paris!
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Amazing dinner
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,4,4,5,"When we were just leaving the restaurant we saw a mouse running From one table to another, there were other diners that saw it and actually some left the place right after that, the food was good though, nothing exceptional..."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"What an amazing restaurant, amazing views of the Eiffel Tower. We sat outside with heating lamps that kept you warm and the ambience was incredible. The food is fantastic and the service is over the top. Highly highly recommend this restaurant"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Love love love this restaurant ! Great food!! And best view of Eiffel Tower in the city, no doubt about it! üíï"
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,3,1,5,My food came out cold. The Service was horrible due to it being under staff but the view was amazing.
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,3,1,3,"Had birthday set as reservation . They pretended they did not see. Service is very basic for what  you pay. Usually wine is poured by waiter but our waiter was not helpful at all after we had our food. We had to flag him down So many times to get menus snd attention. It‚Äôs very uneven - food was good- views of course are nice. Techno music playing , so it‚Äôs for a crowd that likes to pose more than eat. 
Attention to details is obviously is not their best thing- mostly the view is what straits people here"
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,2,2,3,"Great location with spectacular views of the Eiffel Tower! Wish I could say the same of the service and the food. Understandably overpriced, but with the right company it makes for a pleasant night in Paris under the twinkling lights."
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,3,5,5,Festejamos nuestra luna de miel. Los platos son sofisticados pero no llegan al nivel del precio pretendido. Pagas la vista (el show De la Torre Eiffel)
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,4,3,4,"You go there for the ambience, not for service. The food was pretty good but not the best, pretty bland in my opinion. The service was extremely slow. We were a table of 4 and spent about 2.5 hours there. The time between our appetizers and entrees was about an hour wait. We didn‚Äôt get refills of wine and checked up on the entire wait. So in my opinion, I expected more."
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,4,3,5,Subpar food and service for the price- you pay for the view.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Good food and service, it‚Äôs expensive to be outside and a bit cold but worth it"
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,4,This felt like a tourist trap. There was a ‚Ç¨50 per person surcharge to sit on the patio which was never disclosed by open table when booked. The food and service was poor and it was outrageously expensive. Completely not worth it. Never again
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,4,5,5,"Beautiful view, but they charge 50‚Ç¨ extra per person for it which they inform you of after you are seated outside.
Service and food very good."
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,5,"Service was awful, food was ehhh, they charged us ‚Ç¨38 for pasta with butter for our 3 year old and wouldn‚Äôt change it, even though that is what they charge for truffle pasta with fresh shaved black truffles. Never experienced something so absurd in my life."
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,3,3,4,"The food was ok. Came a little bit hot, one thing you guys need to know is that on dinner periods. The restaurant charges 50 euros per person to be sit and enjoy the view. 50 more for each person on the bill.
Including a champagne glass."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,3,5,"Food was very good, the ambiance and the view was spectacular. Service was a little slow but it was completely full. Prepare to pay 50 euros per person to sit outside but it ‚Äòs what makes the whole dining experience amazing."
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,4,3,5,The waiter literally asked me for a specific tip. Very strange moment.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food and service were great as well as the view of the Eiffel Tower.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,We celebrated my 60th birthday here with 3 friends and we had a blast at the Cafe de l'homme. The food was fabulous and the staff was so kind and attentive. the view was out of this world. C'est un magnifique.
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,4,"Comida fr√≠a no sorprendente para el precio, mal√≠simo el servicio lo unico bueno es la vista que no compensa el mal restaurante"
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,3,3,5,They did not bring a birthday dessert with candle but the view was breathtaking
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,4,3,5,"Table charge was 50euros per person
So total cost will be over 150euros per person.
We should know that, before coming there."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,4,5,Fantastic terrace view of Eiffel Tower.  But 50 EU per person charge.  Totally worth it but advance notice would be good.
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,4,3,5,"Te cobran 59 euros por s√≥lo ocupar el espacio por personas, lo dem√°s est√° excelente, pero ese cobro es un robo!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,The most spectacular restaurant ive ever been too .. sit outside
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,4,4,5,"Best Eiffel Tower View, the food great and the service excellent."
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,3,4,4,"I would recommend this place purely for the view. The food was fine, but a high price point for the location and view. Outdoor seating is beautiful. Good wine selection. Unbeatable view."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great experience. Good quality food, excelente service by the waiter‚Äôs, spectacular view, very good location... Ensure to reserve the front view tables if you want to enjoy more. Hostess the exception, not at the circumstances height: rude without reason. Overall, great experience. Go!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,2.0,2,5,1,5,"Lovely food, beautiful setting and atmosphere! It‚Äôs such a pity we were slapped with a ‚Ç¨150 additional charge on top of our bill for simply sitting in the restaurant. Of course we refused to pay it as this was a huge surprise to a small party of 3 people. The manager was extremely helpful, unalike the waiters who were so stuck-up and had such poor attitudes towards guests."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,4,3,5,View View View.  Make sure you understand the 50 Euro seat price before you go.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,4,5,5,Stunning location over looking the Eiffel Tower. Service was outstanding and very professional. Food and ambience exceeded our expectations. Will return when next in Paris. Highly recommend!
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,5,"We were basically ignored for the 2.5 hours it took for us to have dinner. The service was absolutely terrible. I could see multiple people trying to grab the waiters attention either to order or ask about their food status. Once our food finally arrived , my steak was over cooked and dry. And my friends pasta was under seasoned. For the prices on the menu I expected the food to be way better. You are basically paying for the view because that WAS stunning! If you are ok with overpriced and under seasoned food in exchange for a beautiful view . This is the place for you!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,3,4,5,"No lo recomiendo ya que en la reserva no se especifica que te cobraran 50 euros por el simple hecho de cenar ah√≠, con un tema de copa de Champa√±a y un aperitivo p√©simo. D√°ndome cuenta que es selectivo este tema, ya que llegaron dos personas a tomar una pi√±a colada y no se les exigieron. Creo que es un tema de aprovecharse un poco del turista."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We came for our anniversary, and they did not dissapoint! The view was outstanding and the food was lovely! Staff were polite and attentive, we definitely couldn't of gone anywhere else on our special day"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Cafe de l‚Äôhomme was recommended to us by a tour guide, and we weren‚Äôt disappointed.  Great outdoor dining with views of the Eiffel Tower."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"If I could give it 10 stars, I would. Very classy and the best view from the patio of the Eiffel Tower. Amazing salmon, waiter and most wonderful mashed potatoes ever. Would love to know what kind of potatoes they use and how they prepare them. The waiter helped me decide on my three choices and we decided that the salmon worked for me best. He was on point. I will go back there while I am in Paris."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Perfect for a special ocassion. View is unique. Service outstanding, always smiling and helping with photos. Food and Drinks were above average. Probably the best dinner in Paris. It was expensive but worthy"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Exceptional food, exceptional setting, exceptional service..."
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,4,4,5,"We booked Cafe de l'homme after watching World Cup coverage this summer and decided it would be a fun and fancy treat. I made a reservation for noon on a Wednesday which is when multiple websites list them as opening. We arrived to the restaurant a few minutes before noon and had to wait until they started letting people in at 12:20. It was quite annoying and I'm not sure the reason for the delay. Once we sat down around 12:30 I realized the view and the terrace itself were both beautiful, the weather was perfect so we lucked out. However, with the umbrellas up for shade, the view of the top of the Eiffel Tower was blocked. This was the whole reason we chose to eat here, but what we could see what still very nice. My husband and I ordered lunch and drinks and everything was very tasty. We were pleased with the food even though the portions were on the smaller side. At the end of our lunch we noticed the $7 charge for our water which was quite absurd. Lastly, while paying the bill, the waiter asked right in front of us how much we would want to tip him so that he could complete the payment. This was awkward and seemed unprofessional. Overall, I know we were paying for a fancy lunch with a nice view which is what we got."
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,4,3,5,"They do not tell you that you have to pay 50euros per person for the view outside. So that was a great surprise at the end of a wonderful meal. 
I can understand the charge for the view but to not know about it while just blissfully sitting there for dinner. 
When we tried to ask about the policy and the fact that we did not know about the extra charge the manager came over and was very short with us and demanded to know who the hostess was who took us to our seats. Once he found out he said he doesn‚Äôt know if there is anything he could do since we already paid. So he took down our number and email to have the corporate team contact us the next day. It has been over a week and we have no email call or message from them. We are no longer in the country so that makes it hard to get ahold of them but just seems two faced when the manager says they can take care of it the next day and then we don‚Äôt get any for of communication."
Caf√© de l'Homme,2.0,2,2,1,5,"They charge for the view, 50 euros per person. Its  ridiculous . Service is too slow. Food is good but it arrives cold."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Great service, view and food!!!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,3,5,5,"El ambiente estaba muy bien, la vista al Torre Eiffel espectacular, hay muy bien servicio m√°s la comida no me pareci√≥ que tenga la calidad como para ese lugar."
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,4,4,4,"I was at Cafe de L'homme for my fiancee's birthday. I chose it because it has a reputation for having a show-stopper view of the Eiffel Tower combined with a high-end food/service.

Both the interior and exterior spaces are very sophisticated. We sat on the outdoor patio, where the proximity to the Eiffel Tower *would* make for a great view... however, not all seats/tables are created equal. Some are fairly obstructed by the massive statue in the center of the patio, while others like ours could not see part of the Tower because of shade umbrellas over the tables. It would have been nice if, on a clear night like ours was, the restaurant would have closed up the umbrellas to allow patrons to have an unobstructed view. Because they weren't, people like us had to get up to see or take photos of the Tower, which often meant standing next to other people's tables to do so, something I'm sure was a distraction to those other patrons. Given that there is a 50 Euro fee pp to sit on the patio (which to be fair, did come with a glass of champagne and an amuse bouche), it would have been nice to have the umbrellas down for a more unobstructed view.

As for the food, it was above average, though not necessarily outstanding. I enjoyed the escargot, which was presented well and were large and numerous. My salmon was also large and cooked perfectly. My fiancee had a tuna tartare as an entree and a decently sized filet (6.5 oz.) which was nicely cooked as her main. However the desserts were a bit underwhelming. The creme brulee came with no fresh fruit, and when she ordered fruit as a side (for 2 Euro), it came as a sauce, not actual pieces of fruit.

All told I would recommend Cafe de L'homme to others if you are able to get there early and get a choice seat on the patio, but set your expectations appropriately regarding views, food and service. In my experience it was above average, but not the finest dining experience I've ever had."
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,3,4,4,"Obviously you go to this spot for the view of the Eiffel tower first, it's just sublim and wonderful. The prices are on the high end as you can expect, but I found the food just good, not amazing. There could be some improvement there, as well as on the decor which I just needs some update. Now that they have a strong competitor nearby (Girafe), they need to step up their game for sure. Overall a good experience nevertheless."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,4,5,5,Vue exceptionnelle sur la Tour Eiffel ! Service de qualit√© et plats corrects. On vient pour cette vue surtout !
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,First time in Paris and this spot was perfect. Great view of the Eiffel Tower.
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,5,2,5,"Ten√≠amos la reservaci√≥n alas 9.3 y nos dieron nuestra mesa alas 10.3 , se tardaron mucho en hacernos el pedido"
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,2,2,3,"The restaurant has incredible views that are simply undeniable, however, the food and service can be improved. Upon receipt of our bottle of champagne and food, the server was nowhere to be found. I saw she was very overwhelmed by the number of tables she had, so I couldn't fault her for that, however getting anything else ordered, a refill on your glass or even the check took an incredible amount of time. It took so long that we had to skip out on desert and ask for the check because our next reservation was upon us. My fillet was undercooked and my husbands was overcooked as well as being extremely tough. All-in-all I would consider going again for only drinks and desert, definitely not for dinner."
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,5,1,5,"Das Essen war hervorragend. Das Fleisch wurde medium bestellt und kam well done am Tisch an. Auf Reklamation versuchte der Service mit uns zu diskutieren und uns zu erkl√§ren das es in Frankreich immer so ist. 
Das Essen war bis auf das Vorkommen hervorragend. Die Aussicht ist empfehlenswert und f√ºr ein romantisches Dinner perfekt."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,The waitstaff were outstanding. The food exceptional s d the view perfect. A must visit. üëç‚ù§Ô∏è
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,3,3,5,Went for a birthday... they did nothing special. :(
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,2,1,2,"Very bad service and over expensive, do not go there"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,4,5,Engagement proposal
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,4,5,5,"The setting was unparalleled (perfect table placement with perfect view of the Eiffel Tower directly in front of us), the service friendly and attentive, and the food was well portioned and very tasty.  We were surprised with a complimentary glass of champagne to end a very memorable experience.  Would highly recommend!!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,4,5,Amazing experience
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,4,5,"The best view in Paris, but they charge for it."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"THE spot for Bastille day! Perfect spot, great view, great service"
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,1,1,4,"The experience was very unpleasant. 
I have made a reservation for me and my husband, to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The OpenTable recommended me this place as a good restaurant with an amazing view, where you spend approximately 50‚Ç¨+ for one person. However, the actual peace for dinner is different. Be ready to pay 200‚Ç¨ each (no drinks included) in this restaurant!!! In my opinion, this is too much, especially, seeing how waitresses serve French fries üçü for dinner üòÅ 
Well, eventually, we had our bubble drinks and left the place. 
The disappointing part is that there was no information on the OpenTable website, regarding such high dining rates!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,We had an incredible experience here!
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Exquisito restaurante de comida francesa con una de mis mejores vistas dela Torre Ifel.
Caf√© de l'Homme,2.0,2,1,2,4,"The food was horrible - I paid $40+ for lamb chops that tasted like they were a few days old...

The service was not on par with the dine dining experience I was expecting. We asked for blankets and didn‚Äôt get them until right before we left...saying that they had sent them to cleaners. If I were operating the place, I‚Äôd make sure you have enough to support to outdoor tables available. 

They tried to make it up to us by giving us a glass of sparking wine at the end of the evening but it wasn‚Äôt enough to satisfy us. 

I would only recommend going there to have a drink and enjoy the view. I would not eat there."
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,5,4,5,"Went for my girlfriends birthday. 

We were greeted with champagne on arrival (unsure if this is for everyone of those who prebook) and was seated outside. 

The view was incredible and it definitely plays a part in their pricing. Unfortunately the service seemed slow, a table next to us ordered and served their starters before our order was even taken, this was partly our fault due to being indecisive over the good selection on their menu. The other table then ordered their mains the same time we ordered a bottle of wine and their food arrived moments before our wine. 

On the whole an extremely enjoyable and unforgettable evening and would definitely go back!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Hice un viaje con 2 socios inversionistas desde Mexico a Paris, el Domingo por la  tarde antes de irnos de Paris. Los llev√© a comer con esta espectacular y tranquila vista de Paris. Tienes la torre Eiffel enfrente de ti mientras comes. El servicio del restaurante es de muy buena calidad y la atenci√≥n tambi√©n. Llegar es f√°cil, est√° dentro del museo del hombre. El servicio es r√°pido, cuanta con calentadores en la terraza. Ideal para una ocasi√≥n especial. Tienen personal que habla perfectamente bien el espa√±ol."
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,3,2,3,"Its located inside the Mus√©e de l'Homme. Nicely furnished, however they forgot to include a toilet inside the restaurant, so guests have to use the museum toilet - weird.

 Amazing view of the Eiffel Tower, would only recommend going when the weather is nice if not you will end up sitting inside. Without the amazing view of the Eiffel Tower pretty just another over priced restaurant in Paris."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,It was my sister's 65th birthday. She hadn't been to Paris in decades. I wanted some place special. I'd bee to cafe de l'Homme about 10 years earlier and remembered it fondly. It has a killer view of the Eiffel Tower; the food and service had been excellent. Was it still a good choice? I asked some friends who'd been more recently and got the ok. What a treat: from the moment we walked in we were treated like princesses. Service was excellent and the food was very good. The birthday candle and singing were a highlight.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,We was here for my fianc√©e Birthday on Saturday evening 04/05/19 and the atmosphere and food and service was excellent
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excelente atenci√≥n, cuenta con unas vistas impresionante a la torre Eiffel! Volver√≠a sin lugar a dudas!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,4,4,5,Amazing view. Great food. Good value for money
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I joined my Fianc√© for an evening at the Cafe De L‚ÄôHomme, and I can quite easily say it has been more than outstanding.
The view, the ambiance, the food and the service was incredible. 
I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone, and be sure to advise that all be prepared for the light show on the Eiffel Tower each hour."
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,5,5,2,"Lovely food and good variety on menu. Service excellent. Ambiance poor, might be due to lunch."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Be out to eat with a friend, great views, good food and service."
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,4,2,3,"Service was slow, food was lovely but sides came after mains. Lovely view"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Amazing restaurant with closest full view to Eiffel Tower. The staff were really friendly and the food was really great. Overall great dinner place!!
Caf√© de l'Homme,1.0,1,3,1,4,"We were ignored for most of our lunch. The view was amazing, sadly the service ruined the experience."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Wunderbarer Abend mit Diner for two.  Hervorragende Beratung zum Wein und Champagner. Sehr pers√∂nlicher Service mit hoher Aufmerksamkeit. Karte ist eher traditionell als innovativ. Handwerklich top, Produkte top. Wir hatten Seezunge f√ºr 2 im Hauptgang. Gute Produkte, Service und Ambiente haben einen hohen aber angemessenen Preis. Merci!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,2.0,2,2,1,5,"Beware of the douchy host... as he seats me, as I‚Äôm in my chair he tells me there is a $50 euro ‚Äú premium seating fee‚Äù. The seat was outside, not much different than any other seat. Total scam."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"You need to pay extra for a view of the Eiffel Tower, but no one rushes you out the door when you are done eating. You can sit there as long as you want, which is such a luxury. Our dinner was expensive, but it was a once in a lifetime amazing experience."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Incredible views from the patio, excellent service, first class in every way. One of the highlights of our day trip to Paris!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,3,3,3,"Wait staff pleasant. Nice surprise to have champagne compliments of Open Table.  Food was ok, not great. It wasn‚Äôt served hot. The steak wasn‚Äôt cooked to preference requested. 

It is an amazing place to see the Eiffel Tower. Many photo ops. 

For the price, expensive, couldn‚Äôt rate it very high."
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,2,2,4,"No lo recomiendo, muy alto el precio para el nivel de cocina y para el servicio. Supuestamente con buena vista, pero solo si pagas 50 ‚Ç¨ adicionales para estar afuera. Adicional al frio de la √©poca.

No volver√≠a"
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Pretty good food, but not totally worth the money. Said the champagne was on the house but then charged us. Would go back though. Great view of the Eiffel Tower!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Best place in Paris. View of Effiel Tower is unbelievable and the food is crazy good.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,4,5,5,Excellent service. Amazing views of Eiffel Tower!!!
Caf√© de l'Homme,3.0,3,2,3,4,Amazing restaurant with an amazing view on outside terrace. Was a bit disappointing that you have to pay an extra 50 euros each to sit in an area with heaters and a better view to see the aiffell tower. Best to go at night to see the light show which is a great view fro this restaurant. Food was average and did feel like i could make at home.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Watch out for temp on terrace, but otherwise amazing."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Caf√© de l‚ÄôHomme is a beautiful room with an astounding view of the Eiffel Tower. The service was excellent, warm, and hospitable. The food was fresh and perfectly prepared. Don‚Äôt hesitate on this one. It‚Äôs awesome."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I had dinner tonight with a colleague who is also visiting Paris. We had an amazing time at Cafe de l'Homme.  The food was delicious.  The service was very good too, much better than what reviews on Yelp stated. I had the duck and he had the lamb.  The cost was in line with what I would expect from a high-end restaurant in Paris.  I must say the view was priceless.  It was my colleague's first time to Paris, so I thought I would take him somewhere he would remember.  Cafe de l'Homme didn't disappoint."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Beautiful location to see the Eiffel tower and the service was great., would definitely recommend to sit outside."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,3,5,"Tr√®s bon, accueil tr√®s bien et une vue incroyable"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Jonathan and entire staff was outstanding
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"For my husbands birthday. A beautiful view and setting, very special. Excellent food, we had the asparagus / king crab and fillet steak followed by beautiful desserts and cocktails! Great vibe from the DJ in the outside area, would recommend for anyone visiting Paris."
Caf√© de l'Homme,4.0,4,4,5,5,"Fantastic view, great food and amazing service. The staff were very accommodating and polite even though we were being a bit picky with the menu."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,4,4,5,A great place to take pictures of the Eiffel Tower while sipping drinks and enjoying good food.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,You can't beat this restaurant for its incredible night view of the Eiffel Tower. The food was excellent and the service great. Would definitely return or recommend it to anyone visiting Paris.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Fantastic food with a gorgeous view of the Eiffel Tower.
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,Justine our server was so amazing üòâ the servers are so nice!!!! Would highly recommend this gorgeous restaurant!!!
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Incredible experience at Cafe de l'homme.  My wife and I were connecting through Paris heading back to the US on her birthday after spending a week in the UK and our flight was cancelled, leaving us with a spontaneous night in Paris.  Was able to get a reservation here and mentioned in the notes that it was my wife's birthday, and they pulled out all of the stops - window seat looking directly at the Eiffel Tower, incredible service and food, and a surprise birthday desert complete with a song and sparklers.  It was an experience we will never forget.  The food was some of the best i've ever had, and you just can't beat that view...10/10, would recommend to anyone visiting Paris that's willing and able to splurge a bit."
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We were so late coming from the opera right before closing and they still let us in and were so polite and kind, great staff, good food, but the view is obviously the best‚Äîif you know Paris then you know this place and nothing is better than sitting down right in front with the Eiffel Tower as the background. One of the best places to take friends visiting the city or just to grab a drink with friends"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,"What a beautiful place to see the effiel tower !
Also the food was spectacular we had the steak .
Also the waiter was so nice and would send gifts to the table deff a MUST see !!!"
Caf√© de l'Homme,5.0,5,5,5,5,La vista a la torre Eiffel es espectacular!
Sacr√© Frenchy !,2.0,2,2,1,3,"We arrived early which was good as they didn‚Äôt have our booking but thankfully they had a table. Unfortunately the Camembert came cold as seemed like it had been sat out for a while. My partner ordered the ¬£36 steak and asked for it medium well, it came out blue. He said he didn‚Äôt want to wait to cook anything else as I was already eating mine. We had no apology from the chef or any extra nibbles provided. I had the beef stew which I have to say was lovely but just a shame this happened on our last night!"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,3,3,Probably one of the best meals I have ever had in Europe.  I have been traveling to Europe my entire life and the casserole was an elite dish.  Thank you !
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Sandra was amazing and so accommodating ! The food, drinks, everything was great for our last night in Paris ! Merci!"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"First off, the manager was so welcoming and warm. The waiter was also so kind and attentive checking in on me after every course. This will have been my first delve into French cuisine and I felt like the team here were the best to guide me. Cannot say enough good things about this experience and the team that made my special occasion so memorable. Bravo!"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,I had a wonderful time as always! The service was outstanding!
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Fabulous meal, had a great time - fantastic service also :)"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Food was fantastic, presentation was great and flavors were spot on. Service was great, staff were very attentive."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,1.0,1,1,2,2,"We did the New Year‚Äôs Eve menu and it was absolutely a let down. For $150 euro, it was not worth it. The food was subpar, the service just was not great. Overall a let down unfortunately. Maybe it‚Äôs better on another night but I wasn‚Äôt pleased"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,2.0,2,2,2,3,We ate at Sacre Frenchy for New Year's Eve dinner.  It was a 4 course dinner and they were serving a LOT of people.  I think if we would have gone there for a regular meal our experience would have been a lot better.  The food was just mediocre and it was quite expensive.  (our most expensive meal in Paris by far and it was just ok)  We also were waiting between courses a lot longer than the parties seated around us even though we arrived at the same time or before other parties. Service was really hustling but there were so many people in the restaurant.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,1.0,1,1,1,5,"I waited for over an hour and none of my food come. I ended up leaving. However they comp‚Äôd the drinks I had, which was nice"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,5,5,5,"Really great service and menu was good too. The only negative is the seating plan was very crammed where we sat, the couple next to us were sitting very close to our table. Cosy :-))"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,I had a pleasant time in this restaurant in the heart of Paris! The dishes were delicious!
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,5,3,4,The girl should know coffe must be served after dessert. She is so funny you cannot help forgiving her. RECCOMENDED
Sacr√© Frenchy !,2.0,2,1,3,1,La comida no estuvo buena versus el precio pagado.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,2.0,2,2,2,3,"Disappointing. Overpriced for a menu of meager portions and lukewarm food with sloppy service. Dessert was really inedible.
Will not be returning."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,4,4,3,"Cena de navidad en familia, buen ambiente y la comida muy buena, los platos navide√±os muy bien elaborados y de mucha calidad , los postres supongo son postes navide√±os franceses y no estamos acostumbrados a esos sabores  estaban buenos pero son sabores un poco mas complicados  y no le gustaron a todo el mundo.
Pero la comida en general muy buena."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Lovely setting and a very welcoming environment! Everyone was so kind and friendly. We felt very welcomed here and I couldn't say enough about the service. 

Food options were great and there was a little something for everyone including the quintessential French dishes! 

We would come back in a heartbeat. Thank you for a wonderful dinner and dining experience!"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"This was our last evening in Paris, and it was a perfect restaurant. The service was great, and the staff was very attentive with a great attitude. We had our children with us, and there weren‚Äôt any other kids there. But we‚Äôd definitely go back as a couple too. The ambiance was fun and the food was well prepared with a couple options not on every other Parisian menu."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great burgers ! Cooked as requested. Really nice ambience, cosy d√©cor, friendly staff. Nice to find a place that serves food all day in Paris. 

Al three of us had the burgers, but the food on other people‚Äôs tables looked very good too ! A little pricey, but that‚Äôs Paris. Definitely better value than other places I‚Äôve been, and I was really very happy with the experience."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,Unbelievable service! We will be back! Everything was perfect
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Je recommande les yeux ferm√©s !

D√®s l'arriv√©e, on se sent chaleureusement accueilli, l'√©quipe est tr√®s sympathique et attentionn√©e. Le service √©tait rapide et le d√Æner d√©licieux. La cuisine est √† la fois simple, traditionnelle et pourtant sophistiqu√©e, les aliments sont tr√®s bons et go√ªtus. L'ambiance √©tait calme et chaleureuse, c'√©tait donc une excellente soir√©e !"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great experience! super friendly owner and staff.
Delicious French cuisine with generous portions and wide selection of wine.
Fair prices and good atmosphere we really enjoyed our time.
Thank you!"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Our initial experience at this Parisian restaurant was a pleasant surprise. 
The service was notably friendly and accommodating. 
Looking forward to revisiting in the future :)"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,2.0,2,2,3,3,"Food was average and overcooked. Felt like a tourist spot. Baked Camembert was nice. Ribs, burger and garlic toast all overcooked and not worth the price."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Super repas au Sacr√© Frenchy, la nourriture est d√©licieuse et le service est excellent. Je recommande chaudement."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,3,4,4,"Initial impressions were poor. It was a 'rugby' Saturday and we were lucky to get a booking. At first the staff appeared confused and disinterested but suddenly a table appeared and they swung into action. Good, efficicent service after that and the food- albeit simple - was good. Good prices too. I would go back,"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,Everyone was so nice the food was so great. The piano player was amazing (had a front row seat). I had a wonderful dinner and a wonderful time. Ôøº
Sacr√© Frenchy !,1.0,1,1,3,1,"Customer service was fair. unfortunately, every item that we ordered was very unpleasant.  The quality of the food was horrible and health concerning."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great food, fun vibes, great waiter, good wine! Enjoyable and highly suggested!"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"When we showed up, they handed us menus instead of the experience. We actually preferred this and didn‚Äôt ask about the experience.

We had the foie gras and escargot as appetizers. Our first time trying both. Both were delicious, but we preferred the snails slightly more. The snails had a pesto seasoning. For our main course we had the duck and lamb shanks. Once again both were fantastic. To finish it off we had the chocolate and caramel dessert.

They made a big deal about how everything was homemade. Supposedly Paris has a lot of restaurants that just reheat stuff, this want one of them.

On Saturdays after 8, they had a pianist playing modern pop songs that provides lovely background music. Only speaking English was not a problem."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,4,4,4,Super restaurant with great service in a great location!
Sacr√© Frenchy !,2.0,2,2,4,3,"Ate at 5pm on a weekday; unsure if the kitchen staff were rotating or if the senior guys were taking a break but the food was poorly cooked. Kids meal - chicken dry and fries awful (almost burnt on the outside but slightly undercooked on the inside). Croquettes lukewarm, but the rest of the food was fine but average for the price.

Service was good; great staff. Probably rated better as a bar than for its food."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,Everything was amazing - from the food to the service to the ambiance. Our server was friendly and welcoming. The lamb shank was incredible! It was my favorite meal in Paris.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I reserved a table here for my first dinner in France. It was the perfect start to my trip after 26 hours of travel. The food was sublime and my waiter was so kind, attentive and generous. He gave me a great table despite me being by myself. The lamb was the best I've ever had. Highly recommend this place!"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Wonderful experience and great food. Friendly waiter. Only complaint, it was in the high 80s outside and there was minimal air conditioning inside."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,The food was incredible. I had the lamb it‚Äôs the best lamb I‚Äôd ever tasted. Our waiter was amazing. Gave us a complimentary drink as it was my sisters birthday. I highly recommended this restaurant
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Food was really good, escargot was amazing one of the best I‚Äôve had"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,Best dinner i had with my wife for our anniversary staff super friendly and offered prosecco and great service
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,4,5,5,Staff was super friendly and happy to accommodate us! They even brought my sister champagne for her birthday!
Sacr√© Frenchy !,3.0,3,2,4,3,Friendly staff.  I ordered lamb.  It‚Äôs was too dry and lack of flavor.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Delicious food, friendly helpful service, we had such a wonderful dinner! I highly recommend the onion soup au gratin, the duck breast, and the chef‚Äôs ceviche! And don‚Äôt forget to get an espresso with some cr√®me br√ªl√©e for dessert"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,4,5,4,The best service I‚Äôve ever received in Paris. We came for dinner and the your men and lady working here were superb. Price was great. Quality of the food good for the price.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Un lugar s√∫per especial , en Paris , la mejor comida que prob√© en mis vacaciones"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,1.0,1,2,3,1,"Perhaps the experience would have been different outside, but the inside of this restaurant was dark, stuffy and felt rather unclean.  Our server was a very pleasant and sweet young man, but his efforts were not enough to overcome the atmosphere and mediocre food we were presented with, after having been rather curtly dispatched to  the back corner of the restaurant when we arrived.  There are too many nicer restaurants, in better parts of Paris, to even consider going to this place."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"One of my favorite restaurants every time I visit Paris. The service is friendly and the French food is superb, complete with classic dishes"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,good atmosphere and nice dinner with friends.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,2.0,2,2,3,3,"I expected better, given the Chef's credentials. Terrible experience. The bone marrow was flaky and hard. The lasagna was dry. The steak (for two) appeared to have been reheated (at least once but possibly more). Would not recommend it. Service was ok. The ambiance was ok. The location was good."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,4,Wow! First day in Paris we had dinner here. The food was fantastic and the service was great. They even had live music! Definitely recommend.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,4,5,4,"The service was fantastic, the food was good but simple."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,3.0,3,2,4,3,"Why are the ratings so high here? The high rating was misleading. Unfortunately I chose this restaurant because of the ratings for a large party family dinner while we were all visiting Paris. The waiter was somewhat friendly being very direct when someone ordered an appetizer and the waiter restaurant said ‚Äúwe are taking drink orders not food orders.‚Äù   The restaurant had no air conditioning it was stuffy and hot on a summer evening. The food came and wow what a disappointment. Some of us ordered lasagna and it was dry and crumble like with chewy lasagna noodles.
I was excited to bring the family here based on reviews but that was misleading because there was ‚Äúno experience‚Äù other than average service and poor quality food."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,The food and staff make this place super special. Thank you for helping us celebrate my daughters birthday.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,4,4,It was one of the most memorable places we ate at while on vacation.  Would recommend.   Might should check your bill though.  Ours was wrong.  Could have been a honest mistake.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,Amazing service and they made the night enjoyable for the kids!
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,2,Lovely lunch here and so appreciate the fine staff. The only downside is its location in the main street where the noise of honking horns and sirens affected our dining experience! Maybe add some partitions to block the sounds.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"1/2 chicken was phenomenal, smoked salmon was a hit, beef cutlet was soft enough to cut with a butter knife, and the service towards my family and child was above and beyond."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Nice place and very good service. The waiter tried his best, although was stressed due to more work. He could have saved time and energy just to be a bit more relaxed. Food was great, just onion soop could have been more seasoned."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Great roasted chicken. Our waiter, Alexander, did a great job."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,4,5,5,Came here for my last dinner in Paris before heading back to CA. We wanted a very french evening and Sacre Frenchy did not disappoint Alex took great care of us.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great experience! Staff was extremely helpful, quick, and very friendly. Highly recommend picking up the foie gras and octopus as appetizers!"

Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We were visiting Paris for 2 weeks and choose this restaurant based on our larger party of exchange students visiting from several countries. Our servers were fantastic! They gave us a large area upstairs and we were the only ones for quite some time. All of our food was amazing, and I again cannot say enough about our wait staff. They even took pics of our group which was truly appreciated. We won't be back to Paris until 2025 but we definitely have this as a favorite on our list."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Servicex, food and atmosphere was great!! I would certainly go back"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Fantastic food, great atmosphere, perfect for both children and adults - easy but top quality kids menu and excellent traditional brasserie food, service was incredibly friendly too"

Lo stra consiglio e ci ritorner√≤ nel prossimo viaggio a Parigi."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,5,3,5,Fantastic food and a great welcome.  Staff were wonderful with the children.  Service a little slow and staff clearly very busy.  Overall a wonderful night and first meal in Paris!

Sacr√© Frenchy !,2.0,2,2,2,3,"The food was OK, not great. The service was OK. There was an issue with our wine order where the waiter said they did not have the one we chose and gave us something of mush lesser value which we returned."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Oh my goodness! The best meal that we had in Paris! First, the atmosphere and friendliness of the staff- lovely, quaint, romantic decor and such nice people. The food was excellent- we had salmon and the market fish and shared a wonderful salad with blue cheese, nuts, etc. had a delicious cr√®me br√ªl√©e for dessert. We loved it so much that we wanted to go back, but sadly didn‚Äôt have time. Fantastic evening!"

Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Arrived to celebrate Betty‚Äôs 95 birthday.  Our party was met by the staff and it was beautiful how they treated us.  We were at a table of 4, in a quite area of the restaurant and after we were seated  a glass of champagne arrived along with a treat.

We all ordered our food and while waiting for it to be prepared a candelabra with 3 lit candles arrived for a most pleasant surprise to our evening.  Our food started to arrive and it was like an orchestrated symphony!!!  Each dish was precisely timed so that we had time to not only enjoy our plates but was able to share everyone‚Äôs too.  It was a magical experience that the entire staff made specially for Betty.

Upon our leaving the manager stopped the live musicians and the entire restaurant sang Happy Birthday and once again another glass of champagne accompanied by sparklers!!

I simply can not express the love that Betty felt from the staff but also the restaurant patrons who welcomed her 95 birthday.  Betty came to Paris to not only celebrate her 95 but to be here in Paris for 30 days to check another ‚Äòbucket list‚Äô item off.  She still has more to go I can assure you!!

Sacre Frenchy! is not only a great place to dine but the entire staff makes you feel like your home!!

Thank you for every single thing you all did to make our evening an enjoyable experience‚Ä¶."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Toujours un plaisir de venir d√©jeuner au Sacr√© Frenchy !
Les plats sont savoureux et g√©n√©reux et l'accueil toujours chaleureux.
Une valeur s√ªre"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,De vuelta en Paris y muy buena cena con amigos. Com√≠ una sopa de cebolla y un magret de pato
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"First outing in Paris and very good atmosphere with a good dinner with friends.
On the other hand, as it was Tuesday evening, there was no piano and we will come back to hear it one weekend :)"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Professional lunch, classic menu with an attractive price. Amazing"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,1.0,1,1,1,4,"Our waitress was a complete MESS! Instead of taking orders on paper, she chose mental memory which didn‚Äôt work out at all. After waiting over an hour for our appetizer, she asked us to repeat our order so she could check in the kitchen. We were confused because our order should be inputted in their system being that she proclaimed to put them in. Nevertheless, we waited another 20 mins for the appetizers to arrive. Not once did she check to see if we needed a refill, being that we now have been waiting for 1 1/2. After two hours‚Ä¶ and no entree, I politely reminded her that we yet to eat. She acknowledged and rattled off an excuse. We witnessed everyone who sat
In her section experiencing the same low quality of service and we all discussed our frustration. When I finally was given my steak (which she ensured me was a filet, but was most definitely not) it was rubber and I couldn‚Äôt even chew it. All the while, the manger sees this chaos and just doesn‚Äôt correct the problem. I was beyond my breaking point. This was my worse dinner experience while in Paris. I walked out hungry and disappointed."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,1.0,1,2,1,3,"Terrible service, the worst I've had in a long time.  We were at our table for almost 2 hours and received 3 visits from our server, only 3.  #1 hello after 20 minutes with an apology for the delay and said she would be back.  #2 took our drink order. #3 delivering our drinks and took our food order.  The kitchen delivered our food.  That was it. No check on our food, no additional drinks, just terrible.  Got up and asked for our check, and stood at the front area to get our bill paid and asked for our remaining food to be take-away.  15 minutes and no boxes. Got up and asked for boxes, she took our plates from the table and ended up dropping one of the plates with all the food on the floor.  We left in shock."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Don‚Äôt be fooled by the humorous name, this is a high end restaurant with great food and attentive waitstaff. The service was a little slow, but above par in general. Highly recommend."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We spent valentines dinner here and it was an amazing experience! The specialized menu was delicious, the ambience was romantic, but the staff were the absolute best! They made us feel so comfortable and welcomed. Highly recommend and we will definitely be back!"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Sacre Frenchy was fantastic! My girlfriend and I went for her birthday and we‚Äôre greeted with a flute of champagne! The waiter was lovely and gave us plenty of space. We ordered the French onion soup as an appetizer, which was excellent. One of the best I have ever had. I got the 8h lamb and mash, which was outstanding if you can handle rich foods. She got the vegetarian lasagna, which was very good but had a very tough shell on top. Neither of us were able to cut through it without feeling like we were going to shatter the plate. Despite this, the interior was a tasty vegetable medley. We then ordered the cr√®me br√ªl√©e, which came out with a sparkler and a song! It was such a wonderful night of food, wine, and conversation. I would highly recommend Sacre Frenchy to anyone visiting Paris."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,Belle d√©couverte.

Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Overall good food! Steak was amazing and cooked to perfection, the fries were okay, generous portion but overcooked. Lemon meringue tart was delicious and a perfect end to the meal! 

Nice location, exceptional staff and beautiful atmosphere."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Had a great evening, the food is traditional French food, great atmosphere, live music. It was busy but we were looked after!"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,3.0,3,3,5,5,In Paris for a friend‚Äôs birthday. Had been before and had a great time so felt like a safe bet. Menu was reduced and options not as great. Think we may have ordered badly but would think twice about going back. Service was friendly and efficient and the restaurant had a nice atmosphere though so maybe worth another try!
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,4,5,5,Wanted to try a good Escargot and French onion soup; this place did not disappoint. We loved it! We last minute decided to get Cr√®me br√ªl√©e and it was an amazing delicious decision.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great food and best service. Everyone was friendly and the food was delicious and reasonably priced

Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Very nice place where we had a great time with friends and family in Paris!
Many French specialties with fresh products. I just ate too much ;)
Thank you to the bartender who made me discover Calvados to digest well."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,1.0,1,1,1,1,"I made a booking on the day - my daughter and I visiting Paris for the first time. Restaurant was a good 30 min away from the hotel so we have already spend money on the taxi only to be greeted by the rudest man on the planet to tell us he knows nothing about the booking as he does not check his online bookings. After making faces he gave us a table next to the piano with the speaker right into our ears, but I was glad we were not going to have to go back hungry. After another 20 min of making faces, he sent the waiter to TELL us we had to move to the corner table as the table was obviously booked. 
As you'd expect, we have left and shared experience with our hotel who promised to share it with their guests. And I will be sharing this with anyone I know. The only rude person we have encountered on our trip works at this restaurant."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,4,4,4,Food was fresh and tasty! Service a bit slow but still great when interacted. Piano player and singing was an excellent touch!
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,Welcoming environment and staff. Great drinks and food. Very Frenchy! Loved it
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Food was fantastic. We had the French onion soup, foie gras, and magret, all of which we thoroughly enjoyed. Live music from the piano player made for a great atmosphere."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,4,4,5,The service was great and there was a beautiful ambience with a man playing the piano. We made a reservation of 9 for a birthday celebration and all had a lovely time!

Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Service, food and location is great"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,4,3,4,Imaginaba un Men√∫ m√°s variado
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,4,5,5,"food was exactly what we expected - so beautiful and full of flavour. The service was attentive and bespoke. It‚Äôs all we wanted from a Parisienne experience as tourists!

Live music was a big bonus too. And then night ended with a rousing group performance of Aux Champs-Elysees! G√©nial!!!"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Let me first say people who gave this establishment one or two stars suffer from a black heart. There can be no actual justification for such a bad review. Not only was my experience contrary to that review this restaurant opened in June of 2020 and is still around.  Any restaurant that opened in the height of COVID and still survives is a quality establishment 

As for my experience  we were warmly welcomed upon arrival. Our waitress, Auda, was wonderful, she was warm and attentive, the food , lamb chops and beef were very good. I have nothing to complain about.  The atmosphere was fun and the piano player made the night complete.  Yes there were smokers outside, Parisian love to smoke, they are everyone. But that did not take anything away from our experience. If we make it back to Paris we will definitely come back and I highly recommend eating here."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great bistro setting. Food was great and our waitress went above and beyond with not only our meal but helping us to get a cab off a busy Paris street.  We will definitely go back!!
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,3,5,5,Outstanding service. Went above and beyond for us and the family. Great experience.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,Charming service and delicious food.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,3.0,3,5,1,4,"The service was extremely slow, even by European standards. We had two appetizers and a drink, and we were still there for over three hours. We tried to flag our server down to even get more water and couldn't do that."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,2.0,2,2,2,2,"Let‚Äôs start with the first impression: a noisy lounge-like ambience with patio smokers surrounding the entrance; the sound of ‚ÄúAmerican rock classics by piano‚Äù wafting through the front door. This could be fun, if not completely contrary to the website‚Äôs description of a Michelin chef‚Äôs reinvented fever dream (the exclamation point should have been a red flag on fire). Overcrowded, understaffed, we were shuffled to a barely lit corner of the restaurant to be tossed menus without any word from the waitstaff before they quickly ran off to the demands of another table. Soon after, the ma√Ætre d brought us a candelabra (a nice touch, admittedly) before scurrying off hurriedly. My gorgeous dinner guest and I laughed it off before gazing at the menu and we immediately realized our mistake to see a list of food items commonly found within √éle-de-France somehow Americanized, described in terms more common √† l'anglaise. We ordered the Burgundy snails and received dried, overly cooked earthworms encased in fragile pouches (half of which were so baked they couldn‚Äôt be extracted from their shells). After waiting nearly a half hour for our waitstaff to return, we then ordered a cheese board which, to be fair, is hard to flub up before we both agreed to forego the main course and, instead, concentrated on our mediocre bottle of vin rouge, the pianissimo tunes of Elton John twinkling in the background. We soon left for another meal elsewhere after etching our initials into the waxed candelabra, sauntering into the night Parisian air a bit wiser in the world‚Äôs ways."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,Absolutely incredible
Sacr√© Frenchy !,3.0,3,3,4,4,Service was good‚Ä¶food was indifferent.  Lamb chops were fatty with lots of gristle.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,4,3,4,"Not a big drinks selection, nevertheless food was good as was the ambience and atmosphere."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,Nice diner with friends from other countries. We had dinner and we sang with the pianist. So fun !
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,muy buen almuerzo con amigos. Gracias !
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,4,5,5,Enjoyed Sacre Frenchy- great area with a lot of buzz.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,3.0,3,3,4,2,"A little crowded at the tables, lots of smokers, food was just OK, service was good."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,1.0,1,1,1,1,"This meal was our only bad meal in Paris, and it was hilariously bad. We found this place on TripAdvisor and they had wonderful reviews and gorgeous pictures, so we were really excited. For our main course, we ordered the butchers daily beef, medium rare, with peppercorn sauce  - sounded like a great steak au poive to us! When the meal arrived, we were presented with three skewers of small beef cubes, all cooked well done. Not what we were expecting at all! We ate the meal, the fries were decent, but we were disappointed. To top the meal off, we decided to skip dessert, but were offered some Calvados, an Apple brandy from Normandy. We thought this may be a sweet nice dessert, but it was basically cheap tequila. We laughed through the disappointment, and left to get dessert elsewhere. All in all, felt like a tourist trap with overpriced, not great food. Definitely felt bamboozled by the TripAdvisor page and I‚Äôd warn others to be wary of what they read!"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,4,5,5,Waitstaff was incredible!!
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,5,2,4,Our food was great! But service was terrible. Our waitress was far too busy sucking up to another table to pay us any attention. First she got our wine order wrong. Then 1 food order wrong. She never came back and we were pretty much finished by the time someone came by and my friend said she‚Äôd ordered something and didn‚Äôt get it. He brought it over. The next time our waitress came over was after we had finished and asked for the check. They were not even that busy.  Very disappointing.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Top Lokal! Sehr familienfreundlich. Wir hatten einen wundersch√∂nen Abend, mit sehr gutem Essen."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Food was great French onion soup, foie gras, burratta escargot, terrace seating and server enjoyed her job. Very enjoyable. All good"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,4,5,5,American family who dined there.  Great experience- waitress was extraordinarily understanding to wait on 2 picky young American kids including sending the Frenchy Burger back 2 times (üòî).   Burger was really cooked superbly - rest of food was ok.   But experience was nice
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,4,4,5,Beautiful atmosphere and good food and service
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,4,5,5,"As a large American family in Paris, we were a bit apprehensive about where to go for dinner. We couldn‚Äôt have felt more welcomed. The food was good, not the absolute best but very good for value and overall atmosphere was great. The name of The restaurant sounds touristy but it really wasn‚Äôt. The live music was great. We had a fantastic time and would highly recommend."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,4,5,5,Very cute place with friendly staff and good service
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,4,The people there were very friendly and quite accommodating!

Service by Fifi was wonderful 
Piano player was great
Owner ver cordial"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,3.0,3,3,5,3,"Nice outdoor vibe, GREAT service, the food is average though. The food isn't worth the price though."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent service and food!  We definitely will come back next time we are in Paris.  After a very long day in city center, we went to this restaurant for dinner.  We ordered the charcuterie board and soup to start with as our appetizers.  I wish I would‚Äôve taken a picture of the board, it was so nicely laid out with a good selection of meats and cheeses.  Then we ordered the truffle pasta and lamb chops, which were fantastic.  Service was great too, I think the best service we‚Äôve ever received."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,4,5,4,"Our party was pretty big and the staff couldn‚Äôt have been any more friendly. No one in our party speaks French, however the staff went out of their way to make us feel at home. Top notch hospitality! The food was also delicious. Highly recommend checking this place out."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,4,5,5,"Great waiter 
Great live music
Great position"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Excellent service, food and atmosphere. Thanks for the experience"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,4,4,4,"It was a very memorable dinner in Paris.  The food was 
Delicious and our waiter was very helpful with suggestions and recommendations.  We opted for the charcuterie plate and the burrito to start.   They were prepared with the freshest ingredients.  The cheeses and then meats were such a treat.  Then we had the ribs, lamb chops, the burger and the roast chicken.  All of the main dishes were excellent.  A real find in Paris!"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,2.0,2,2,1,4,Would not recommend‚Ä¶. We were unable to make our planned dinner so used Yelp to find another place close by? This is 1st time Yelp let me down? Very mediocre at best. I had the steak and it was tough and mostly fat. My girl has the pasta and it was very very average. Macaroni noodles ? Maybe it was a bad night for them  but from bread to coffee very poor.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,2.0,2,1,5,4,Clearly a work meet up spot. Do not order the burger! It is terrible and the octopus tasted fishy.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great food, excellent service. The manager was fantastic and made our evening one to remember."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,We went to dinner here for my husband‚Äòs 71st birthday. The food was amazing. Service impeccable. The tell that was attending to us keep such care and clearly liked his ‚Äújob‚Äú that my cousin asked if he wasn‚Äôt the owner. He was. I have never seen anyone buzz around taking care of everything and politely directing his staff genteel and professional manner.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,Very good dinner with my wife when we arrived in Paris. We had a great time and thanks to Alexandre for the surprise !
Sacr√© Frenchy !,3.0,3,4,3,4,Ok but nothing special
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great evening with my friends and very good vibes. Thanks to the team üòÉ
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Great vibe, very friendly service & good food. Would certainly recommend."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,4,"We got our table ready from the arrival time, nice welcoming by hostess, and overall a great experience"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Waiter was delightful! Attentive without being intrusive.
Food - Mille feuille was the absolute stand out. Delightful dose of nostalgia.
Atmosphere - Dated decor, but very clean, beautifully presented."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,2.0,2,3,1,1,Waited 55 minutes before we even got a glass of water. The service was extremely poor. They did acknowledge our wait by giving us free drinks. But I would rather have had better service.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,Everyone was so nice and the food was great. The live music was amazing as well!
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great service and the frites were super tasty!!
Sacr√© Frenchy !,3.0,3,3,1,3,On vacation. A waitress came by and said I will be right with you. She then walked by our table 7-8 times over the next 15 minutes never stopping even though we called out to her several times. The manager came and took our drink orders then another waitress took our food orders Food was Ok. When it was time to pay the waitress made a several mistakes with the bill. She first gave us another table‚Äôs bill. Then with our bill there was a big overcharge which the manager had to apologize for.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,3.0,3,5,3,4,"They forgot to serve our starter, but instead directly served the appetiser. It was then fixed and they did not let us pay for the starters. Aside from that, the overall experience was great and we had fun dining in the restaurant."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,3.0,3,4,5,4,Our booking could not be found but we were seated. The food was lovely and our waiter was attentive and fabulous. We had seafood and it was fresh and tasty. Be prepared to pay around 2.5-3x the price of London. French wines were jaw droppingly overpriced. We had a lovely meal but realistically there are many fabulous places to eat in Paris and to counter the prices- it just needed a little more.
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,4,5,3,"Dinner with friends in Paris, outstanding Cassandra for our service, fun crowd and music, yummy food. Merci, Sacr√© Frenchy!"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,4,4,4,"The owners were very nice and attentive.  The food was okay.  Nothing to complain about at all, but was just okay for me."

Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,4,Very nice and highly recommended!
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,3,5,5,"The restaurant has a nice ambience and the menu includes several French-traditional / tourist-friendly dishes.

It is a very nice option for a casual dinner with friends or family.

The food is good (average given the French standards); but the service is quite friendly and professional; probably this is one of the best assets of the place."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,We went to Paris for our honeymoon and booked this restaurant for the 1 week anniversary of being married. The welcome was amazing. We were congratulated and treated very well. The live piano was beautiful and made it very romantic and fun atmosphere. The food was delicious and good value for the money we spent! Best dinner we had all trip

Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Visiting Pairs on my honeymoon came to Sacr√© Frenchy on a whim after checking open table for good options last minute. The food was wonderful. The waiter was great, and the atmosphere with the piano player was just what we needed for our first night in Paris. Highly recommend this place, also not too bad on the wallet."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Sehr gutes typisch franz√∂sisches Essen, sehr freundliches und zuvorkommendes Personal. Der Chef pers√∂nlich hat sich sogar um ein Taxi f√ºr uns bem√ºht."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,4,5,"El lugar agradable, con un extraordinario pianista en vivo. L√°stima que estaba abajo y no se escuchaba tan bien. La comida muy buena, sobretodo los escargots y el pato ¬°delicioso! Me gust√≥ el ambiente juvenil y con comensales parisinos, cero tur√≠stico."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent food but even better was the waiter Patrice, genuinely one of the best waiters I‚Äôve ever come across, the man deserves a pay rise ! Good live music too"

Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,The best meal we had during our weekend in Paris. As a family of four we found something to please everyone. The ambience was great with live piano music and the staff were really funny and friendly. Highly recommend it.

Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,5,4,5,"Booked for a group of ten on a rugby weekend trip. Staff were super friendly and welcoming and spoke really good English which was a bonus for some of the group. Busy, buzzing, fun atmosphere with a live pianist (playing modern hits, not classics!) and the odd whole restaurant singalong! Food was fabulous - don‚Äôt think anyone didn‚Äôt enjoy their meal, and Al we had a wide selection of foods from the menu. Cocktails and wine were great, too. Service of the food was slow due to being understaffed, but that didn‚Äôt spoil our evening as we were having a blast and they kept on top of the drinks! Would definitely recommend for a fun group meal."
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,4,"On my own in Paris for a night and I reserved a table at Sacre Frenchy. I was not disappointed! Good atmosphere on a busy Saturday evening. The staff were very friendly and attentive and the food was excellent. It was the sort of French meal you used to get all over France years ago but sadly struggle to find so often today.
I had snails from Burgundy which were tasty and nicely cooked and a super pasta with truffle. The house wine was also excellent. Very good value. The best meal I have had in Paris for years. Thank you."

Sacr√© Frenchy !,4.0,4,4,3,3,"We were stuff in the corner most table, and neither of us are  petite‚Ä¶. Needless to say  the restaurant was empty at the time. A little off putting to start. The food made it up for me. The lamb was so tender and the  escargot were delish. The drinks (moscow mule ) were tasty, made perfectly. The wait staff was friendly, and quick on his feet when we asked for attention."

Sacr√© Frenchy !,1.0,1,1,2,4,"Booked on a Saturday for something to eat in Paris having had a few days of wonderful food. 

The restaurant had a live singer who was great and created a great atmosphere to eat in. However, the food was really bad and did not seem fresh. We ordered a few ‚ÄòFrench tapas‚Äô bits (calamari, croquettes and tomatoes and Parma ham on toast) to start. The croquettes were nice but the calamari was exceptionally chewy and the Parma ham was completely tasteless. We chalked this up to a few mistakes and moved onto our mains.

I ordered the ribs from the rotisserie menu. The meat was decent but was served with chips that tasted like they had been sitting for quite sometime before serving. However, my partner ordered the burger which after one bite she immediately stop eating and said it tasted bad. I then also tried it and was immediately hit by flavourless beef which was then replaced by the very unpleasant taste of rancid beef fat which I imagine came from an unclean grill. This put myself and my partner off all of our food and we asked for the bill immediately. We raised this and were offered another burger but the taste had put both of us off our food. We asked for the bill from which the burger had been removed but the food experience had been awful from start to finish which was a shame as the food in Paris is generally at a very good level!"
Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wonderful service by a staff that truly cares about their customers. Good wine list and the soy duck was amazing.

Sacr√© Frenchy !,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I visited on Thursday 21st October for my birthday as well as my girlfriends birthday and the service we received was the best I‚Äôve ever had! From the minute we stepped into the restaurant we were treated like family, from being seated at a beautiful table with candles to even having our very own teddy bear joining us for dinner. The champagne was exquisite, the food the best I‚Äôve ever had. We had the cheese board to start and it was so tasty, then I had the soy-sauce duck for main and it was incredible, so delicate and the sweet potato was cooked to perfection. My girlfriend had rack of lamb and it was falling off the bone it was so tasty! Once we had finished our meal we finished off our champagne and had some cocktails, and then one of the waiters came over and gave us a birthday shot of French tequila as a farewell. Then we had a pianist playing songs for us before we left for the Moulin Rouge. I would rate this place 1000/10 ‚Äî so worth the money and for the staff, I cannot wait to come back ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you so much!"

Whilst the service was good we felt a little rushed from one course to the next. The food wasn‚Äôt exceptional which it should have been for that price.

Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Absolutely divine. Every dish a piece of art and a delicious party for the mouth. Waitstaff beyond attentive.
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Really great experience. Innovative and delicious food with surprises in each course. Service top notch, great explanations of courses and wine pairing. One of the best wine pairings we have ever had. Space is also super chic. Definitely recommend."
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,One of the best meals I‚Äôve ever had. Booked on a whim due to good reviews here and was not disappointed. Staff very friendly and informative without being over the top. Just super good food. Highly recommend.
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Trac√© is a must try. Flavors are both unexpected and rare, subtle and powerful (the food and soft beverage pairing is unique and exceptional), service is perfect, the overall is memorable. Clearly one of the best blind tasting menu I have had in my life."
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,An absolutely amazing diner at Tamara! Chef Clement is an artist. We paired our fixed course dinner with the ‚Äúemotion‚Äù wine pairing. It was a wonderful experience! The service great with our waiters explaining each dish and wine. I‚Äôd highly recommend you treat yourself to this under the radar chef!
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,4,The food is super creative and service is great too
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,This will earn a Michelin star soon. WONDERFUL experience! Can‚Äôt wait to come back.
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Perfect place ! Exp√©rience incredible with the Tamara restaurant.
Trac√©,1.0,1,2,4,1,"Over priced, pretentious and mediocre food. Unacceptable that a place that charges +‚Ç¨200 per person doesn‚Äôt have air conditioner in a place with an open kitchen that elevates the temperature in an already hot summer weather.

Never again"
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing exp√©rience, great service and wonderful food. Highly recommend before it surely gets its well-deserved first Michelin star"
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,3,"Plats parfaitement ex√©cut√©s.

Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,We were warmly welcomed & they offered to accommodate any allergy problems.  The food was innovative and delicious.  Wait staff was incredible and one waiter sent us home with flower seeds from his own garden.  A marvelous and memorable experience all the way around!!
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Visitors to Paris and celebrating a birthday, Tamara‚Äôs prix-fixe menu and accompanying wine flight made for quite the experience.  The dishes were carefully thought out and prepared, focused this evening on seafood and game fowl.  We added an optional cheese course which was exceptional as were the wines from the Loire Valley.   The service was attentive without being intrusive.  Tres bien!"
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"It‚Äôs been a wonderful journey to discover new flavours, textures and aromas. A must do."
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,4,Beautiful and well curated menu. Knowledgable and friendly staff.

Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Everything about this meal was amazing. The attention to detail. The textures. The creativity. The wine pairings. The excellent staff of 5 was attentive and passionate about the food and restaurant. We would definitely go again.
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent food and impressed with the service. The tasting menu was definitely worth it
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,We had the full menu with wine pairing. It was fantastic - all dishes perfectly balanced and great fits with the wine. Service was super friendly!
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing dining experience! Great food, great wine, and a wonderful staff. Will bet first reservation the next time I am in Paris."
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,3,"Tamara was a treat. We dined there after a few nights of Michelin-star restaurants (which won't be named) but we enjoyed this night the most. Fantastic service and wonderful food. We particularly liked the ""2-dishes in succession"" theme made with the same ingredient (eg. Monkfish) and the portions were perfect. They were very communicative beforehand and accommodating during dinner with our dietary intolerances (one gluten, one lactose). The wine pairing was very good, not spectacular, but very reasonably priced (‚Ç¨65). The ambience is nice but not great with quite small tables which are not easy to be comfortable sitting at. All that said, I would recommend Tamara wholeheartedly."
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,4,We enjoyed the tasting menu - it was fantastic and I highly recommend to take the wine paring as well.
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Wonderful service and cuisine, perhaps the best and most interesting I've ever had."

Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The restaurant had a warm and welcoming ambiance. The staff was knowledgeable and attentive.
The food created was all works of art and flavorful.
A complete awesome experience. Highly recommend"
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"From start to finish the menu was creative and perfectly paired with creative French Wine Selections.  Timing of service, and quality and thoughtfulness of each course of tasting menu was compatible to a 2 or 3 star Michelin establishment, without the stuffy tablecloths and pretention.  Bravo!  We will definitely be back soon!"
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,This was the best testing menu we have ever had. Flavors went well with selected vines..

Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Superb food and wine. Great service. A young chef providing one of a kind menu.
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We chose the paired tasting menu; every course delighted us. Every bite was exquisite, artfully presented, and memorable (it helped that we were compelled to photograph each beautiful course). Service was elegant and impeccable. The simplicity and sparseness of the decor lent intimacy to each table (though we conversed a bit with American diners at the table next to us; we still enjoyed the privacy). One of our favorite dining experiences ever."
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"It was a phenomenal experience. From the tasting menu to the drink pairing and highly informative and attentive staff, Tamara delivered well above expectations which we‚Äôre already quite high.

Highly recommend."
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,An incredible food and wine experience! The food is delivered like a work of art and the way they use ingredients is like a science. Five star the whole way with very friendly staff too! Amazing ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Nous avons f√™t√© notre anniversaire de mariage chez Cl√©ment Vergeat au restaurant Tamara.

Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,4,"My wife and I had a great meal at Tamara. The gastro cooking was amazing and quite an experience. I am lactose intolerant and they accommodated my needs easily (even though we opted for the tasting menu). It's hard to describe gastro cooking, but needless to say it was a 2.5 hr meal with many small courses and a delight for your taste buds."
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great food. Friendly and knowledgeable service. Great experience. A hidden gem! I strongly suggest you take the wine pairing.

Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"What an experience! Tamara is A hidden secret with a wonderfull ambiance and outstanding menu. We were blown away by all the dishes, great ingridients, unique tasting impressions.

Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Absolutely exceptional!
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"This was hands down my best meal in Paris. I am hesitant to post pictures because they will not do the food and experience any justice.

From the first bite, a lighter than air crisp with its own aoli to the stunning desserts, this meal was a masterpiece. Each bite is not only satisfying, it is also brilliant. You get surprising textures, plays on familiar tastes and hints of wow on almost every plate through the courses.

Add to that, an attentive wait and kitchen staff working to ensure that you have a culinary journey that you won't soon forget. This was remarkable."
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"wonderful place, service, food"
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,4,"The chef‚Äôs tasting menu was fantastic and manageable.  We were delighted and satisfied at the end of our meal without feeling overly full.   The alcohol pairing was also thoughtful, interesting, different and always elevated the dish."

Trac√©,2.0,2,1,4,3,"It is of of these sad cases where everything is there for a wonderful experience except for the talent of the team. Some of the positions (most amuse vouches) were just atrocious, inedible. The rest just passable. The crew tries hard, but they just don‚Äôt seem to have what it takes to make a special restaurant. So sorry."

Great service and wide choice for the wine list."

Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wonderful restaurant. Having been to other Michelin star restaurants it has got to be only a matter of time before Tamara is rightly rewarded for a stunning meal.

Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,An outstanding meal!  The entire team executed with precision and the teamwork was impressive!  We were fortunate to secure a same day reservation. We fully recommend an evening at Tamara!
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,4,"The chief has a very special and unique point of view. Everything was beautifully done and contained the personality of the chief. This is a kind of new cuisine, and certainly worth a try for foodies."
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,4,5,"The most amazing food, using the whole produce across many dishes following the restaurants ethic of minimal food waste. Flavour profiles were superb, execution is immaculate, excellent wine.

Service is well presented and formulated. Small negative is the waiting time between courses. 

Our tasting menu lasted for over 4 hours, however the experience was worth the time 

5 Stars, would return without question."
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Exceptional! We had a wonderful evening at Tamara with the staff, ambience and food being outstanding.

Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Tamara is now my favourite restaruant in Paris.  The meal was exquisite in every way.  The sseet menu has manhy delightful surprises and went really well with the wine parings.  Every course was exceptional from both an aesthetic and a gastronomic perspective.  The service was informative, while also discrete and charming. The whole ambiance and decor is also fantastic, understated but elegant."

Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Absolument g√©nial, meilleur exp√©rience :-)
A recommander absolument"
Trac√©,4.0,4,4,4,5,"Good foods and very friendly service. If you come early dinner, the chefs might be the one serving some dishes for you. 

I can see and understand what the chefs are trying to accomplish with their foods, it just not quite there yet. Will be interesting to see how they develop their menus. Some are really nice, but some just lack of excitement. I think they also need to speed up in between courses, I had to wait with empty wine glass up to 30 minutes between main courses."
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,This was a wonderful culinary experience! We endulged in the tasting experience and it did not disappoint. Highly recommend!
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Cuisine inventive et tr√®s pr√©cise. Service agr√©able et fluide.
Trac√©,3.0,3,4,2,2,"Tr√®s bons mets, service trop lent (dur√©e 2h30) banquette d√©sagr√©able, salle bruyante, WC difficilement accessibles."
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent tasting menu with wine pairings. A true experience. Would highly recommend.

Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"My wife an I dined at tamara and had the Chef's suggestion/tasting and wine pairing experience. It was an amazing evening of dining on cuisine like nothing else we have experienced before. It was creative, fanciful, and served with a wonderful presentation and it all worked together. We can not begin to explain it, you simply have to experience it for yourself."
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Very casual intimate setting.  Great tasting menu!  I would go back!!
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,4,5,Amazing food and service
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,A truly amazing experience. Staff was attentive. Food was sublime. Space was intimate and thoughtful. I wish we had restaurants like this in NYC!
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,4,5,As creative and inspirational as any around.  A must visit when in Paris.  Food was outstanding.  Initially the service was solid but as all 10 or so tables filled up the service turned negative.  Wine is stored in a warm area so be prepared.  In spite of the wine and service the food trumps all.  Note the menu is nothing like what is shown on this app and plan on $100 each just for the food.
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,What an amazing dinner. Catered to all my dietary restrictions while giving an unforgettable experience
Trac√©,2.0,2,2,5,2,Not the ambiance you‚Äôd expect from a nice Parisian restaurant - too many casually dressed people allowed to dine. The food was very average. The main dish was slices of white meat pork which was dry and lacked flavor. The other plates were OK. Maybe the chef had an off night but you can do way better in Paris than here.
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great food from the tasting menu. Nice to have personal service as well.
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"One of the best meals I‚Äôve ever experienced.  The creativity and uniqueness of the dishes was over the top.  The chef planned the meal around a story.  9 courses told in 4 chapters.  The servings were proportioned so that having that many courses was not a problem.  We chose the wine pairing for each course as well.  The wait staff was friendly and professional and explained each course and how it fit the story for the evening.  They also knew the particulars for each wine paired with the meal.   Speaking of wine, they offered the chance to view the wine cellar to choose your wine in case you wanted to do that.  Each course was delicious and nothing I‚Äôve had anywhere else.  The restaurant itself is fairly small and certainly not ornate.  The focus is on the food.  It‚Äôs not inexpensive by any means but it‚Äôs worth every bit.  If you are visiting Paris, get a reservation for this place."
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,I‚Äôve eaten in many top notch restaurants. This is up there with the best.  I whole heartedly recommend a visit. Outstanding from start to finish.
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Outstanding!
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Absolutely the best food experience we have ever had in Paris. Do NOT miss out on Tamara. They are worthy of multiple Michelin stars, and the price point is reasonable. Thank you to our servers and sommeliers for the most delicious food, the best experience, and a fantastic wine pairing. I will be coming back here on my next trip to Paris."
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Fantastic experience! Highly recommend.
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,This was an exceptional culinary adventure with an atmosphere and service that is unmatched. The artistry in the dishes is something that you won't experience anywhere else. The chef is a master!
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,The chef's creativity with food was amazing!  The chef is clearly one of the top chefs for modern French food.  Would definitely go again.
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The chefs tasting menu was one of the highlights of our recent stay in Paris. The passion of the entire service team was contagious! 

Highly recommended!"
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,This was perhaps the best meal we have ever had. Reviews were so complimentary I was skeptical it could be as good as reviewers said- but it was! The tasting menu and wine pairing were simply spectacular. Our experience lasted nearly four hours and it was special every minute. If you love food you will love this experience!
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Phenomenal meal and experience! Intimate setting with knowledgeable staff and inventive dishes. We will visit every time we come to Paris!
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"This place was incredible! Definitely a foodie Valhalla! The tasting menu was a tour through plants, meat and fish like no other. Yes, courses are small, but much like the architecture in Paris, you just savor each bite before it is gone!!"
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I will return to Paris and when I do, I might eat every meal at Tamara. I will tell every person I know that if you eat one place while in Paris; it should be Tamara. I will tell anyone who ever asked me about the best meal ( I will tell them Tamara. I might book a flight just to come to dinner there tonight. Unlike anything I have ever tasted, unlike any dining experience - ever. Just go."
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I cannot put into words how incredible the journey was that Tamara took my mom and I on last Saturday! From the decor, to the ambiance, to the friendly faces of the team, to the delicate complexity in each dish‚Äî no detail was spared! We were seated at the chef‚Äôs table and as our meal went on and the restaraunt grew packed we loved to see each table come up to the counter to try one of the evening‚Äôs dishes and see the magic in their eyes the same way we had felt when it was our turn. Incredible that they put in such effort to make everyone feel from their food! Will highly recommend and cannot wait to come back over and over and over again! Thank you, Tamara team!"
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Incredible foodie experience! Highly recommend for a special meal. Do yourself a favour and do a tasting menu - you'll discover flavors you've never tasted before.
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great dining experience. Food was wonderful and the service was first class.
Trac√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"My fianc√©e and I visited from New York and this was the most absolute dining experience that we have ever had! I have studied culinary arts in the states and have worked with many incredible chefs. Chef Clement was amazing, his style and unique way of creating these dishes was truly an amazing experience. We had the Pre-fix menu andThe taste was just the perfect. In addition to the wonderful cuisine, the service was absolutely outstanding which is something that stands out for this restaurant. They are a contemporary french style with a total of 5 people including the chef and sous chef. I am allergic to shellfish and they were able to accommodate all the dishes for me which was amazing."

"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",3.0,3,4,5,3,While the food was tasty the portions were extremely extremely small -  as in a few tiny bites worth for what appeared on the menu as a dinner serving. It would be helpful to explain that to patrons. So the recommendation reflects the taste not the value.
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"Des assiettes aussi d√©licieuses les unes que les autres, des √©quipes passionn√©es et un service comme on en trouve peu, dans la joie & la bonne humeur.

"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"Fantastic experience would recommend. Delicious food and wine.

"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great food and ambiance. I am coeliac and the chef made sure I have the same amazing experience with gluten-free options.

"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"This was a wonderful experience. Relaxed but expert service from a very knowledgeable waiter. Delicious tasting menu with very interesting and well judged wine pairings. Flavour, texture and balance in every dish. An oyster with peach granita, fried basil and lemon roe was the amuse bouche. A delicious hint of what was to come. You will not be disappointed! Great restaurant!"
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,We came in from Boston. This place was so great. You could tell they really cared a lot about everything.
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"Ôøº Each dish was beautifully presented, creative, interesting, wine list, and pairings. Our waiter did amazing job, taking care of the whole restaurant.

"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,4,4,"We ordered the tasting menu with wine paring.  The food started with a single oyster in its salty brine with a passion fruit sauce, which set a delicious tone for the wonderful meal that continued to unfold with a nice balance of wines.  The armpsphere was casual and fun with everyone enjoying the food and vibe.  Beautiful presentation for each course...and why not have two desserts? Loved it!"
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"Second visit and just as amazing as the first one.

A place to visit each time in Paris. 
Well done!"
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"There are no words to say how amazing this place is. Honestly not sure why it isn‚Äôt Michelin-starred‚Ä¶ Each course was a unique blend of flavors that left us wanting second helpings.  The vibe was so cool- laid-back without being too casual, super intimate, and welcoming. We also went to Palais Royal restaurant while in Paris (which has 2 Michelin stars), and Nellu‚Äôs dishes outshined the former (and at a fraction of the price). Highly, highly recommend."

"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"I booked a table at Nellu after passing during a short trip to Paris, and wanted to treat myself to a special meal out. The food and experience did not disappoint!

The 7 course menu with wine pairing flowed seamlessly and I loved watching the happenings of the street as the evening wound down.

The food was expertly considered, with texture and flavour balancing well and always made me wish for one more bite before the next course arrived.
Thanks for a lovely evening to all the team."
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing experience at Nellu, the food and staff were both incredible!"

"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,We loved this place. Food was superb and great variety of good quality wines from small growers all over Europe. Definitely going back.
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",4.0,4,4,5,3,"I heard about this restaurant from many ‚Äútop‚Äù lists and wanted to try before leaving Paris.  I did the tasting menu which was very good food.  I wasn‚Äôt blown away and while it‚Äôs a gastronomic menu there should have been 2-3 more courses to the ‚Äú7 course‚Äù tasting menu which included literally, a few courses which were spoon fulls of food.  For the price the ambience was a bit disappointing.   Country kitchen wood tables and high top chairs are not my venue of choice at this price point.  I think the crowd is geared more towards millennials than X‚Äôers looking for a more quiet and romantic experience. However if you are a foodie and want to be in a trendy place with hip music, don‚Äôt mind the high price point, and enjoy gastronomic experiences this definitely is a good choice.  I‚Äôm happy I went and this is certainly a very authentic place in the Paris scene. If you‚Äôre a tourist at this price you may want to go to a restaurant with a spectacular view or more luxurious ambience."
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,Absolutely fantastic! Will be a go to whenever we are in Paris. The food was extraordinary.

"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"We celebrated our 23rd anniversary sitting outside on a beautiful Paris evening at The Nellu. The Nellu was a culinary delight from start to finish. The chef is top notch and so creative. We loved the 5 fromages, which was out of this world, followed by the artichoke dish and pollock which were both works of culinary art. We ordered both the blueberry tart and strawberry lavender desserts which were to die for. We are pescatarians but the meat dishes seemed to be getting rave reviews as well.

Our waiter could not have been nicer and recommended the perfect champagne and was so knowledgeable. He even ran a couple of blocks to give me my phone, which I had left on the table. The Nellu is a must and is in a very fun part of town as well. We will be back!

Thank you Open Table, we would not have found this hidden gem without you!"

"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,Everything was fantastic.
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"Affordable gastronomic lunch menu, outstanding ambiance and very good wines"
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"Super restaurant ! 
La nourriture √©tait top. Accord met et vin g√©nial.
Cadre sublime"
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent restaurant and service you must try during your time in Paris. Small cozy place, lots of choices in natural wines. All the plates were a nice discovery and exquisite."
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,Our favorite restaurant in Paris! Highly recommend.
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",4.0,4,4,4,4,Fun casual little wine bar. We had the tasting menu with wine pairing. The food was wonderful but the wine was only ok. Loved the layout and ability to watch the kitchen staff and chefs preparing everything.
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",3.0,3,5,2,4,"La cuisine est bonne mais ch√®re, et malheureusement le service ne suit pas. 
Pour un bar √† vin c‚Äôest tr√®s dommage que le serveur ne soit pas plus pr√©sent et ne donne aucun conseil. 
Les prix sont beaucoup trop hauts par rapport √† la qualit√© de service."
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",2.0,2,3,2,2,"Accueil tr√®s froid, service long. Les plats sont bons mais pas √† la hauteur des prix pratiqu√©s"
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",4.0,4,5,4,2,Only night in Paris.  Food was great but ambiance is definitely lacking
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,Great food great chef and great wine! And people really friendly
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,4,5,5,"It was a wonderful way to end our trip to Paris. I had the chef's tasting menu with wine pairing. My husband decided to order a la carte and have our server and house somellier recommend wine pairings for each of his courses. He was absolutely in heaven, as was I. definitely on the list of places to return to."
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,We visited for dinner and had our favorite meal in Paris. The kitchen accommodated severe allergies/dietary restrictions incredibly well. We had the chefs tasting with wine pairing and every dish was impeccably prepared and presented. The wine pairing was unique and was a perfect match for our food. Cannot recommend enough.
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",4.0,4,5,4,5,"Great food and ambience. Would recommend a visit. Only down side was that our booking was at 9pm - understand that the restaurant (or at least the kitchen) shuts at 10.30 but we did feel a bit rushed. I always believe if you take a late booking, you should allow time (at least 2 hours, when it's 4 of us) for diners to enjoy your restaurant."
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",4.0,4,5,4,4,I had the chef‚Äôs tasting menu with wine. The food was excellent.
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",4.0,4,4,4,3,Nice dinner but not as wonderful as described here by others. We had the chef‚Äôs menu with wine pairings.
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,Absolutely spectacular! We had the chef tasting menu with wine pairing and it was such a delight.  You can feel how much passion the chef put into each dish.
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"Very cool vibe, small intimate spot we had a room to ourselves. The staff was incredible and very accommodating. The wine selections were delicious and priced fairly. The food was amazing, I had Skate Wing with couscous and the flavors were balanced and very delicious. All in all this was a top ten for food and wine experience. Highly recommend."
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,4,"Lunch a sunday in August. 
The place was quiet and the meal great."
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,3,We did the chef's tasting w/ wine pairing. It was delightful and each element of the meal was bursting with flavor. We appreciated the wines that were paired throughout and the explanations of each course. 5 stars for everything but 3 stars for ambiance because it was really hot (no A/C). Would love to go back on a less hot day.
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,Superb food. Highly recommend the chef‚Äôs menu with wine pairing. Very fresh; gorgeous presentation. Went 2 nights in a row it was so good!!
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,The best dinner in Paris!
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,Great chef menu and wine selection for size of the resto
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,4,"We loved this new, small and intimate restaurant- what a find! The food was delicious and definitely a bit different (in a good way).  All the flavors were delicious and beautifully presented.  We also enjoyed chatting with the knowledgeable and friendly staff and chef.  What they manage to produce from their tiny kitchen is extraordinary.  Can‚Äôt recommend highly enough."
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"Way better than expected, original food, awesome flavors, a whole experience. Excellent service. A must in Paris."
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,4,"Restaurant was smaller the expected but food, wine and enthusiastic young staff soon made up for it. Great choices of wine. Food was very tasty with old classics with a modern twist. Highly recommend."
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"Super exp√©rience, tr√®s bon moment pass√©. Le cadre est magnifique, les serveurs adorables, la d√©coration raffin√©e‚Ä¶ La nourriture √©tait d√©licieuse, les portions parfaites et la carte des vins aussi !"
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"The most interesting, delicious, and perfectly prepared and presented dinner ‚Äî and it happened on our first night in Paris!  Totally amazing. We ordered the chef‚Äôs choice and loved every single bit of it ‚Ä¶ but no meal since has compared!  This place is amazing."
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,We had an amazing meal with lovely wine. The service was fantastic; it was a great evening.
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"I‚Äôve had the good fortune to travel the world and eat some great food which also means I can be quite critical. This experience, and I use the word intentionally, was nothing short of amazing. The food was just awesome, the flavours they pack into their dishes are very refined, extremely well balanced and equally daring. Adding caviar and salmon roe to a hollandaise over asparagus, the kick of heat on the Korean beef tartare without numbing your palate, the theatre of the dancing Katsuobushi on the mussels risotto, and the intensity of flavour in pressed beef shoulder with a rhubarb sauce .. just amazing. A calm, unassuming decor, 20 or so seats inside, a small but attentive team. Can not fault this!! 2 courses, without wine, ‚Ç¨50pp is great value!!"
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,4,"The food is incredible. Really unusually good and money can‚Äôt buy food like that where we live in uk
We asked to meet the chef and he was also serving us! They had only been open two months and he said he‚Äôd worked in Michelin starred restaurants. 
Highly recommended!"
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"This place is easily on its way to being one of the best restaurants in Paris. Do yourself a favor and go and order the entire menu (not exaggerating, it‚Äôs that good)."
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"We thought we‚Äôd give Nellu a try as it was close to our hotel in le Marais and we liked the pics of the food on the website, plus the other reviews were good. But we were completely blown away with the food - it really was exceptional! I had the beef tartare, which was exquisite, and my wife had the dancing pasta, which she is still talking about. Not to be outdone, the wine recommended to us was also sensational. And the staff were super friendly, knowledgeable and eager to show off their prowess. One of the chefs even had a chat with us after the meal. Just positive vibes all round - I‚Äôm expecting to hear big things of Nellu in the future. Well done guys!"
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,Visiting Paris with my daughter and stumbled upon this hidden gem.
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"A restaurant for the gourmets! 

Really flavorful but at the same time delicate plates, dynamic and generous wine choices (do consult the sommelier, he was really helpful) and a charismatic team.

Overall a place with character, definitely give it a go."
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,Perfect food and service. Best gin&tonic in town.
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"Short and edgy food menu (all dishes were delicious). Amazing wine list, a wine lover will recognise iconic bottles and rare finds. Classy, modern design in a typical Parisian boutique, located on a charming street in city center. Friendly and helpful team."
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing wine list, friendly and knowledgeable staff. Definitely a must do for wine lovers."
"Nellu, Food and Wine Bar",3.0,3,4,3,3,"Pourquoi des tables hautes inconfortables?
Bouteilles de vin √† des prix vraiment excessifs"
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Absolutely lovely place. The food is excellent, the service very attentive, and amazing cocktails."
L'Empire du 8√®me,1.0,1,1,1,1,The photos and reality do not match. A tourist restaurant. Service and atmosphere is poor. Food is very average.
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Really lovely place , charming and helpful staff."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Lovely place with stellar service quality. Great menu and cocktail
L'Empire du 8√®me,4.0,4,4,5,4,This is a nicely decorated restaurant with good service. We had the chips and they were a bit over cooked so that was a bit disappointing however I had the chicken dish and it was really tasty. The dessert was delicious.
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,That was really good. Thanks for the warm welcome and birthday surprise
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Incredible experience in a such charming place, everything was perfect !

L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Absolutely spot on and perfect place. Atmosphere, food, service , cocktail. Amazing"
L'Empire du 8√®me,4.0,4,3,4,3,"The service was prompt and friendly. The food was just above average, cocktails were better. It was not a busy night. Watch your final tab. We were asked for a 20% tip, unaware that the taxes on the bill were 10% and 20%, yes 30%! Yes we gave 20% as we felt a little bit pressured."
L'Empire du 8√®me,1.0,1,1,1,3,An absolutely awful dining experience. Charged over 600euros for two; the service was terrible. Had to get up to find a server after sitting for 20 minutes just to get water. Entre came out bland after waiting over 2 hours. Advertisement said there was live music but there was none. Avoid this restaurant.
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Superb place, i was even greeted with a complimentary glass of champagne for my birthday. nice touch"
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,We loved the food and it was our first meal in Paris!  They were very welcoming and extremely accommodating to our family of 15!  We loved everything we ate!
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Delightful place and wonderful food. Great service. Thanks
L'Empire du 8√®me,1.0,1,1,1,1,It is a very mediocre restaurant with poor service and average food with exorbitant prices that does not meet any expectations.
L'Empire du 8√®me,3.0,3,3,2,3,"Food was okay. Seems to be a very American restaurant. The food was okay, probably feasting off the location. When the bill arrived the waiter asked if they could add 20% to the bill which is not customary in Paris - that was disappointing!"
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Perfect location near champs elys√©es, good food and vibes. Great advices from the staff for the choices"
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Solid meal, great service , and amazing christmas atmosphere."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Our family of 5 from the US dined here for Christmas dinner. The atmosphere, service and food were all excellent. We had the salad with vinaigrette dressing, the stuffed chicken with curry sauce, ribeye steak, cod and risotto with shrimp. For dessert we had the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and the chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. Everything was delicious. 10/10, A+."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,What a lovely and great evening. Food was insanely good and the service too
L'Empire du 8√®me,3.0,3,3,4,2,"The restaurant presents a good choice of menu, and the food is average. The service was very good, the personnel was friendly and nice. However, the prices are too high for what it offers and for the location being it in a non tourist area in a quite anonymous street. I wouldn‚Äôt go back."
L'Empire du 8√®me,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Bastante bueno. Excelente servicio. Regresaremos, sin duda el chef lo vale"
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,It was so nice. Food was amazing and staff made the experience even better

L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,The highlight on my Parisian tour. Exquisite food and great service
L'Empire du 8√®me,3.0,3,4,1,5,"The waiter applied a 20% tip without our consent!
Please take better care of tourists!"
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Tr√®s belle adresse √† 2 pas des Champs Elys√©es,
Les plats sont exquis et le service de qualit√©,
Que demander de plus ? ‚ù§Ô∏è"
L'Empire du 8√®me,3.0,3,4,3,3,"Good excellent but service not what we expected. Quite amateurish. Walked past serving staff eating as we entered. Waiter had food stain on his shirt when serving us and his breath smelt of alcohol. He was unable to offer any real advice about the wine selection. Overall, despite the great food, not somewhere I would recommend."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Loved the restaurant. Relaxed and knowledgeable waitress. Delicious menu
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Fantastic food, the staff were friendly and helpful and the restaurant itself had a great vibe. 9 of us in total for a birthday celebration, the staff really did make it one to remember and the food was delicious. Good value for money too for a large group."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The perfecf mix  of location, food quality, service and atmosphere. Highly recommanded"
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I absolutely loved my dinner at l'empire while i stayed in paris. The good and drinks were amazing, but the highlight was the service. So warm, welcoming and made us feel at home. Very attentive. Will definitely come back"
L'Empire du 8√®me,1.0,1,1,3,2,"Wir und ein weiteres Paar, das wir kennen gelernt haben im Restaurant haben sich auf die OpenTable Bewertung verlassen.  Leider stimmt diese nicht mit dem was wir vor Ort erlebt haben. Die Qualit√§t des Kalbskoteletts war so schlecht, dass man es nicht essen  konnte. Auch der zweite Versuch war nicht viel besser. Warum ein wird in solchen Zeiten noch eine solch schlechte Qualit√§t liefert, ist nicht nachvollziehbar. Auch das in der Vorspeise gereichte  Tatar war von schlechter Qualit√§t. Ein weiterer H√∂hepunkt war, dass das Weinglas einfach vom Tisch genommen worden ist, ohne dass man noch ein weiteres Glas bestellen konnte. Als absolute Kr√∂nung erwies sich, als man die Rechnung bestellte. Der Kellner verlangte tats√§chlich 20 % Trinkgeld
Dieses Lokal sollte man nicht besuchen, wenn man in Paris ist. Hier gibt es viele, viele andere Lokale, die deutlich besser sind. Leider sind wir diesmal auf die Bewertung hereingefallen. Ich hoffe es werden nicht weitere Leute darauf reinfallen."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Outstanding service and food. Live music later in the evening for a good atmosphere
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Everything about this restaurant was amazing! Staff treated me so well and were so friendly, the food was beautiful, drinks kept flowing and music was great - I had a great time"
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Our reservation at another restaurant was cancelled last minute so I looked to see who had availability within the next few hours day of. This place was highly rated and had good vibes via photos so we decided to give it a try. 

I am so happy we did. the food was amazing and service was even better. The staff made us feel like life long friends. They had a DJ around 10am and he was great too! I can't wait to visit again next time I am in Paris."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Unbelievable experience. A real Paris gem. This was our first time to Paris and this restaurant captured the essence of everything we envisioned that Paris has to offer. Truly a special experience, with fantastic service, eloquent vibe and exquisite food."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Lovely and lively restaurant with very flavorful dishes
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,The service was excellent. The food was amazing. Everything was perfect. Highly recommend.
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Absolutely wonderful diner and spot on service. Perfect
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Amazing food and reasonably priced (for Paris). Great service and really interesting menu choices.
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,The best octopus I ever got. And amazing cocktail as well. Great restaurant
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Lovely late diner , the waitress was splendidly kind and nice. The food was perfect. Recommended"
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Everything was exceptional. Food, service , ambiance. Great music as well. Charming staff."
L'Empire du 8√®me,1.0,1,1,1,1,The food was edible but not good. Both of us  ordered different things.  The restaurant is dark and smoke filled.
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Very nice restaurant . Food as satisfying as possible. Great atmosphere
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food and wine pairing was excellent. Friendly staff. Great place
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"As described on their page , the second shift is more animated with more music and party atmosphere on the week-end which is exactly what I was looking for. The dishes were delicious and the service meticulous. Great place"
L'Empire du 8√®me,4.0,4,5,5,3,"First, the food was really quite good. The food deserves the label Ma√Ætre Restaurateur that the restaurant has been awarded. For us, we were expecting based on the reviews and pictures a slightly different dining experience and atmosphere. I don't think we were particularly the clientele targeted for the restaurant, for example, it seems a little more the type of place people go before heading out to a club, and the music all night was Nikki Minaj. In some ways, I would say the food's presentation, quality, and attention to a more refined detail didn't quite match the dining experience for us, but don't let that stop you from visiting this very good restaurant."
L'Empire du 8√®me,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Down a very quiet street but once inside a great ambience and very attentive staff. Made us feel welcome and showed my nephew how to tackle his first experience with snails! Food was great, service even better.

We dined early but was soon filling up with a very cool clientele. 

Would recommend as somewhere off of the tourist map but still very welcoming to visitors."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Everything was delicious and the place is lovely. Recommended
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Absolutely delicious and possibly one of the most careful and pleasing waitress. Everything was lovely and tasty.
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Very good food.  From the bread on the table to wine selection, to the perfect sized portions...everything was great. Authentic decor...reminds of Moulan Rouge??!!
A bit pricey...but hey its in Paris ;)"
L'Empire du 8√®me,3.0,3,3,4,4,Friendly service. One of our dishes came out cold. Overall decent experience for an option that had a kitchen open at 11p.
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Very good food. Excellent location and service. Very friendly waiters
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent restaurant. A must do in Paris. Recommended
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Upscale environment with romantic mood and comfortable seating.
Food was unique and tasty."
L'Empire du 8√®me,2.0,2,2,5,3,Our server was the highlight. So nice and spoke some English which helped as well. Our appetizers were the Ceviche and the Beef with Teriyaki and both were very good. I tried the Bordeaux wine and the Pinot Noir and was not impressed with either. We both ordered the Grilled Rib Steak (Medium-Rare) and substituted for truffle potatoes instead of fries. They came out so Blue (deep dark red inside) I think they cooked it for 30 seconds on each side. We sent them both back and they came back Rare (arguably still less than rare) I had to send mine back again to finally get a medium rare/medium finish but that was rather pointless because the meat had zero flavor whatsoever. It took 2 minutes to chew one piece. You get some sauces to dip in which helps with the lack of flavor but the chewiness was exhausting. This is not what I expected for 44 Euro‚Äôs. It was a piece of cheap meat with chunks of fat attached all over. I can buy the cheapest steak at the grocery store and do infinitely better. They did give us a free dessert which was nice since we really didn‚Äôt eat our main course together and ended up being there much longer with the multiple re-cooks. Would‚Äôve been better to have removed my steak from the bill at that point.
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Fantastic dinner. The food was absolutely delicious especially the octopus. The waitress was pleasantly great. Really nice place
L'Empire du 8√®me,3.0,3,3,4,3,"We expected a bit more , food was ok, the bill was close to 200 euros for dinner . Service was excellent."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,A very charming restaurant with great menu and very nice waitress. Cocktails were amazing as well
L'Empire du 8√®me,4.0,4,4,4,4,The food was good and the service very nice.  The truffle pizza was delicious and one of the cheapest things on the menu.
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Beautiful restaurant, great food, excellent people. What else would you want in Paris?  Their truffle pappardelle was just over the top."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,i made a very late booking yet everything was fantastic
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excelent taste. Good price. High level of quality.

Very clean."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Tasty menu and great cocktail. Service was good. Music a bit loud but it was late
L'Empire du 8√®me,1.0,1,1,2,1,You can find bad food even in Paris. Tourist trap close to Champs Elysees. Food is rewarmed and largely tasteless. Stay away.
L'Empire du 8√®me,3.0,3,3,5,2,"Food and decor was ok.  Very weak wine selection. 
 Service was good though."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Very nice place , got a little surprise for the celebration I was having. Quite crowded for a Monday (unexpected but pleasing ). everything was great. Will come back"
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Food was absolutely delicious. Scallop carpaccio, grilled octopus, beef tartar, Dover sole, was all so yummy we order a whole second round of them."
L'Empire du 8√®me,3.0,3,4,3,4,"The food was good, except for desserts, but we were pointedly pressured to leave a ‚Äútip‚Äù beyond the normal service charge which is included in all restaurant bills. Indeed, they lied to us and said that they had not included a service charge. That, if true, would be a violation of French law. Dessert choices were mediocre. We had saved some red wine to enjoy with a cheese plate, but they said that they had run out of cheese (even though we were early diners.) Ridiculous! They could have restocked by purchasing some right in the neighborhood. The dessert we finally, reluctantly, chose was a heavy, thick, and poorly tasting tiramisu. The exact opposite of a good one. This unsatisfactory meal did not deserve a ‚Äútip‚Äù. And we resented being lied to and taken for fools."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,What a pleasant surprise. Everything was absolutely spot on
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food and ambiance was amazing. I highly recommend.

L'Empire du 8√®me,3.0,3,3,3,4,"Food was good, not great, and the service was fine. Nice atmosphere and a good menu from which to pick."

L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,A very good restaurant that has a good aura as well. Food‚Äôs great as the service and music. It seems the first shift is traditional and the second one is mixed with music and party vibe on the week end.  Loved it

L'Empire du 8√®me,1.0,1,2,2,1,Looks like it should be in Las Vegas.  Everyone there was American and not the worldly types.  Came here last minute.  Just don‚Äôt
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,It wasn‚Äôt full so maybe I got extra care but the service was absolutely amazing and the food delicious. Will definitely come back
L'Empire du 8√®me,3.0,3,3,4,3,"Really disappointing. We picked this place because it had so many great reviews but the food was not good. Steak was practically raw even ordered medium. One lamb chop overdone, one practically raw on the same plate. My husband‚Äôs glass of wine was undrinkable."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Octopus and escargot were amazing
High recommend"
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Extremely attentive staff and absolutely delicious food
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Arrived late at night into Paris and stumbled upon this incredible restaurant. Every dish was as amazing as the last. Recommend 5 out of 5!
L'Empire du 8√®me,2.0,2,2,3,2,"Wir haben uns das Restaurant ausgesucht weil wir eine neue Interpretation klassischer franz. Gerichte gesucht haben. Das angebotene Essen auf der Speisekarte hat auch unserem Wunsch entsprochen. Bei Ankunft hat sich dann aber schnell herausgestellt, dass das Restaurant sich eher an Touristen und internationale G√§ste richtet. Das Ambiente war nicht der Preisklasse des Essens gerecht geworden. Sehr laute Radiomusik und auch eher etwas flapsige Bedienungen. Die Getr√§nke waren sehr gut, Cocktails und Wein waren wirklich lecker. Das Essen per Se war sehr teuer und nur in der unteren Mittelklasse der sonst gewohnten franz√∂sischen K√ºche wiederzufinden. Es war nicht schlecht, aber eben auch nichts besonderes. Die Preise daf√ºr waren aber extrem hoch, daher nur zwei Sterne."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Delicious food and outstanding service. What else
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Very friendly restaurant with charming waiters. The food was excellent as well
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We happened upon this restaurant on our first evening in Paris, so we did not know what to expect. It was not a large restaurant, but it was not cramped. The waiter was wonderful, enduring my failed attempts to speak French, I had the lamb, and it was amazing, cooked perfectly, and served with a delicious sauce and perfectly prepared vegetables. I wish I could give more details, but I was very jet lagged. All of us loved our dishes and highly recommend this restaurant."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Amazing food and exceptional service. I wood recommend the octopus and the truffle risotto to anyone !

L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Fantastic place and great service. The menu is excellent
L'Empire du 8√®me,4.0,4,5,5,4,"Don‚Äôt judge a book by its cover applies well for this restaurant. We consider ourselves huge foodies, always looking for off the beaten path gems, and staying away from overly recommended and popular Paris restaurants. We were attracted to L‚Äôempire du 8‚Äôeme by its menu online and immediately made a reservation, which was last minute as we had unexpected changes in plans. At first the atmosphere worried us, as it felt more casual and what most would consider high end, but we were quickly blown away by the incredible service, impeccable plating, flavors and presentation in each dish. It turned out to be one of the best restaurants we went to in Paris! The food was prepared perfectly and the balance of flavors and ingredients was very impressive. I would not miss this restaurant if you like Mediterranean-esque cuisine. If you have a larger party, the cellar downstairs has an incredible atmosphere for an intimate group gathering."

L'Empire du 8√®me,3.0,3,3,3,2,"It was ok. Was expecting something much more decadent based on the reviews. The food was just ok, I ve had better French food. A bit over priced for what your get. My lamb chops were over cooked, which is not great for that dish; but they were tasty. The servers are nice, but it‚Äôs pretty basic. I would not come back."

L'Empire du 8√®me,4.0,4,5,5,3,This restaurant is very good but the DJ set starts around 21:30 so the music is way too loud in the dining area I understand the bar area but the dining room makes it inconvenient for conversation.
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Great option for date night, food was good and the service was great. Decor is very glam. A Paris gem!"
L'Empire du 8√®me,4.0,4,5,5,3,"Staff lovely and the food great. Music and sound system a bit unsophisticated and let down the ambience down a bit. Interior felt a bit tired too, compared to images, but overall the staff were very attentive and meal was good."

L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,The service was really good. I asked for a little birthday presentation to me made for my partner as it was her special day and they went over and beyond to make sure she felt special. üôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæ

L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great dining experience , showed up one hour earlier, yet managed to sit us straight away even though it was quite full. Nice host"
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Went to diner on 12/26. Excellent starter (foie gras). Following an  absolutely delicious octopus. A perfect tiramisu to finish. Would dine again !
L'Empire du 8√®me,3.0,3,2,5,3,The filet was great. The veal was alright. The mac was torched/crunchy and not very flavorful. Staff was lovely. Just a lot of money for the quality of food.
L'Empire du 8√®me,3.0,3,3,5,2,"The service was friendly and great. However, The other raving reviews about the food must be fake, this isn‚Äôt a high end restaurant at all. The decor is outdated and extremely cheap and tacky, the food is not bad but definitely not worth the price. They‚Äôve priced their food similar Michelin restaurants yet should be more on the level of a dive bar."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,What a lovely and fancy place. We ate so many good things. The octopus is really worth trying. The wine selection is actually very nice as well.  Cocktails were visually a bit simple but absolutely delicious.
L'Empire du 8√®me,1.0,1,2,1,1,It was a disappointment. The waitresses  and  the environment looks so messy and not clean. The food was ok but the rest of all was a big mess. Very different environment of what to see in photographs. Worst meal in Paris ever .
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"How lucky to find this restaurant open on Christmas Eve. And I never expected it to be so full. Red atmosphere, staff with matching colors for this nice diner. Definitely recommending L‚Äôempire du 8eme"
L'Empire du 8√®me,4.0,4,4,4,4,"We ate lunch at L'Empire du 8√®me on Christmas Day.  The food was very flavorful:  shrimp risotto, lamb curry and scallops in lobster sauce.  Delicious--we mopped up the sauces with their wonderful baguette.  Entree of fois gras was the best I've ever had.  We shared a buche de noel which was in a pool of anglaise sauce--lovely."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Oh, what a night! Unable to get into Septime for our one night layover in Paris ‚Äî the night did not disappoint. We arrived too late to go to many restaurants and did not want to sit on top of a lady at the bar at L‚ÄôAtellier Joel Robuchon, so we searched for an alternative. Everything on Yelp was closed as per usual since COVID wrecked the world. Thanks to Open Table we happened upon L‚ÄôEmpire and made our resie! From the moment we walked in the door to the time we left this was nothing short of one-of-those magical evenings in your life. We were greeted with a genuine smile and taken to the best seat in the house ‚Äî the corner table. Soon after, we met the lovely and knowledgeable Vanessa, our server / undercover sommelier. She introduced us to a lovely new white, Condrieu. She helped us order a near perfect meal. We started with the escargot, of course and a Caesar salad. Both were delicious! She earned major points when she realized everything we ordered was seafood and Caesar salads in Paris always come with chicken. She also saw our Open Table profile noting the pescatarian/vegetarian preference. Thank you, Open Table and thank you, Vanessa for catching that. Hubby‚Äôs Octopus was OUTSTANDING‚Äî wow!!! But, aside from the beautiful presentation by another wonderful server/staff member, the taste of the Sole was underwhelming. For the most expensive item on the menu, I hoped for more flavor, but it was light and fine. The sides were INCREDIBLE. We had the truffle mash (note there is a 5Euro up charge that I didn‚Äôt catch on the menu) and the fries. I will dream of both of them. We were too full for dessert, so we had the cheese to go and enjoyed it this morning from our hotel room. It was also divine and a perfect French breakfast! Aside from this spectacular meal, the staff and especially Vanessa are worth the visit. She is one of those beautiful, well-traveled old souls who lights up the room, makes you feel welcome and loves FOOD & WINE as much as YOU do!"
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,4,"The service was exemplary. I had the octopus and my date had the beef fillet. They were both better than the equivalents we‚Äôd had earlier in the week. The escargot presentation was unique, in my relatively limited experience, but excellent. Highly recommend."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great service
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great place, nice food, and top services. Thanks."

L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,4,"I actually booked the wrong restaurant and was about to leave but  the wait staff in particular Yasmine was so pleasant so accommodating I decided to stay and so glad I did.
After a Parisienne weekend of lots of rich food I decided to have something quite simple but done so well.
Food was delicious especially the truffle mash. But the food was only surpassed by the smiles and happy demeanour of the waiting staff.
I felt so at home and even though it wasn‚Äôt busy on a Monday at 10pm I can imagine at the weekend to be quite the spot.
I‚Äôd go again if nothing more than to see Yasmina again"

L'Empire du 8√®me,4.0,4,4,4,3,"Nice place for late night dinner and good food, but very loud rock/rap music from the boxes.

Be sure to save room for dessert (another excellent recommendation from Vanessa)! The next time we‚Äôre in Paris we‚Äôll be back.
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"If you are looking for a place to eat in Paris, I would HIGHLY recommend this amazing restaurant. We went for my partners 30th Birthday, and they had champagne for us to celebrate free of charge! That little touch makes the experience even better. 

Food was out of the world, the lamb shank and the pan seared chicken is a must! 

Will 100% be going back!"
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Went for my birthday. I had a blast. Amazing food and superb service.

L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,The restaurant was really good. We had booked last minute after missing our reservation at another restaurant. We were not disappointed. The food was good. The customer service was amazing and the staff were very welcoming. There was also music playing and the lighting/mood/ambience were good. They even gave us an English menu.

L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Whzt an amazing diner. The staff was outstanding, the food exquisite and the place changed around 10pm with mood lights and superb music."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I booked this without ever having  been to Paris, so I had no clue the neighborhood or distance from hotel- just went off pictures and reviews. I was looking for something local with ambiance. This restaurant did not disappoint. We had a very late dinner due to a train delay and they accommodated us as if it were no problem. Our waitress recommended a fabulous wine. We enjoyed the lamb shank and risotto- just perfect for tired travelers. They also accommodated us easily with an English version of the menu- which I appreciated as I know very little French. Great overall vibe, food and staff."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Yousef and the crew here are amazing! 
We booked last minute for a large birthday dinner and they treated us quite well and we loved the food, the drinks the ambience everything!

L'Empire du 8√®me,4.0,4,5,4,4,The sole was wonderful but the place was empty early. The sole was not service deboned?
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We were visiting Paris for the weekend from London and looking for something classy, fun, with good food and not too expensive on our first night. L‚ÄôEmpire did not disappoint. We had the rib stake sharing platter, green beans and fries for a main (they even made them truffle fries for us as an off the menu request), and had the amazing chocolate cake for dessert. Everything was cooked wonderfully, flavourful and fresh. You may have to wait a little while for the courses but it‚Äôs worth it for the freshly cooked meals. The service was amazing and everyone so friendly. The host Youseff in particular took care of us and even treated us to a shot at the bar.  We were made to feel very welcome. The ambience is great too with mood lighting and a live DJ playing urban music on a Friday night. Highly recommend !"
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wonderful service with great ambiance! Food was amazing!

L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I came to Paris with a large team of colleagues and with 24 hours notice booked L‚ÄôEmpire for dinner on a Friday night. I originally thought we would be 15 people- so the very nice staff offered me the private room‚Ä¶ then around 30 people from my team turned up! The staff were so nice to us despite our poor organisation- the food was great, and the private room was perfect for a large group. Merci bien!"
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,It‚Äôs a very cosy restaurant. Food is great. Thanks

L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The ceviche was absolutely exquisite, as well as the chateaubriand. Nice wine selection as well."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The host brought us to the table , then the waiter gave us some great advices, the food was excellent as well as the cocktails"
L'Empire du 8√®me,4.0,4,4,5,3,"Good but not ‚Äògreat‚Äô food. There are bistros that are way better, but this place has the intimacy aspect down."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Formidable restaurant. I came to eat within the hour, I stayed almost 3. Delicious."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, and even more superb services.  Thanks"
L'Empire du 8√®me,3.0,3,5,1,3,"Food was really good, creative. The waiting staff however were not really interested in taking care of us even if the place was not busy at all."
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,I came for a lunch near the Champs Elys√©es. Left very surprised. It was fantastic.
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great place and food to celebrate our son's graduation.
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,Absolutely fabulous! Upon arrival we we're greeted with complimentary champagne. All of the food dishes were amazing especially the octopus. When we left they even gave us two complimentary shots. The service was fantastic!
L'Empire du 8√®me,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing food , great service and extra welcoming host."
L'Empire du 8√®me,3.0,3,5,3,3,"I was there for a special occasion and they didn‚Äôt ask why, they didn‚Äôt try to make it so risk and it was okay.  The food was great though!"

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Je suis d√©j√† venu plusieurs fois, je n'ai jamais √©t√© d√©√ßu, les plats sont bons, l'endroit est impeccable, le service est extr√™mement attentif, d√©licat et tr√®s gentil, on s'entend parler"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,4,I was so happy to eat at another Jean-Georges restaurant this time in Paris.  It did not disappoint!!  Good meal and service.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Merci pour ces 4 soir√©es/diners nous √©tions tr√®s contents comme d‚Äôhabitude. √Ä bient√¥t David S√©bastien
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,5,2,4,"Excellent food.  Restaurant very understaffed, perhaps because during first week of the year?   Not the level of attentiveness required for a restaurant of this caliber."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,"We enjoyed dinner on 12/28 so much we returned on 1/2.  A repeat performance.

Wine, drinks, food and service were great.

Place not to be missed."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,5,4,"I liked the food here, nothing different or amazing but good quality food for a pretty good price. Service was good and the staff were friendly."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,5,1,needs to up date with the location and high standar
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,1,3,"Our waiter was sick and sneezed near
Us several times.  Our wine order was forgotten. The food was inconsistent - raviolis and pizza were delicious but chicken was tough and beef was completely raw in places- but cooked perfectly in others. Samosas were incredible. The only other thing was that the waiter asked if we wanted to tip when we were told service was already included so that was a bit confusing. The staff was friendly."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,5,Everything on the black plate was delicious. The service was great. Be sure to order sides.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,2,4,"Hello, the food was exceptional, but we had a reservation and it still took hours to give us a table, hours for them to take our food order."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,4,1,4,"They were severely understaffed: took us 45 minutes to get the champagne we ordered and even then we had to call. We arrived at the restaurant at 9 pm, our reservation and left at 11:50‚Ä¶
Food was excellent and the manager very gracious, they could not find the wine we ordered so instead gave us a very good magnum.
We know Jean=Georges from the US., food is excellent, and overall it was a good experience albeit somewhat slow: decor was nice, music (DJ) good but for the price we paid we certainly deserved better service."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Absolute worst experience on New Year‚Äôs Eve. Poor service, timing on everything was off. Waited 45 minutes at our table after being seated to order a beverage and order dinner.  Had to ask repeatedly just for knife to cut steak, by time it finally arrived- meal was cold.  Certain dishes never even showed up! So some of us ate while the others sat there with nothing.  Drinks ordered never arrived. We left after three awful hours as we couldn‚Äôt bare it much longer. Two of the four left first because it was just awful.  Never even saw dessert, my husband and so tried waiting but eventually gave up.  Trying to get anyone to get our bill (essentially for nothing) was an obstacle.  We went to coat check and left.  Will need to pay over the phone in due time when management calls or returns our email. So disappointed, especially as we have enjoyed fabulous meals at other locations all over the world as Jean Georges is a favorite of ours.  Never have we experienced something like this.  Just several weeks ago we visited Topping Rose in Bridgehampton NY and it was perfect!! 
Still astounded this was a Michelin."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,5,1,"Hard to know where to start. We were not informed of price set menu ahead, totally over priced and inappropriate for our group.  Made the best of it and ordered.  Drinks took 40 minutes to arrive at the table, and food arrived at the same time.  The steak was gamey and inedible, was too raw, they offered to cook more but it wasn‚Äôt seasoned or prepared so that seemed pointless.  Truffle pizza was good, but looked disgusting, brussel sprouts mushy, salmon dry.  The waitress was lovely-but advised us against the set NYE menu option in favor of al a carte which was still $190 euro per person.  The DJ began at 9pm and was atrocious volume, multiple tables complained and a speaker was moved. Would never go back or advise anyone to dine there, holiday or not. Total bill was about $1200 euro and terrible."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,4,1,1,"Food was amazing, unfortunately there was no indication of the pricing as reviews and Google say that per head meals typically cost around ‚Ç¨80. Upon arrival we received the menu which was ‚Ç¨200+ per head + wine on top. This was disappointing for us that they could have at least given an indicator of this.

Service was very slow, they brought out the wrong knives and smashed plates. They were nonetheless friendly, just not good enough for what we paid.

Ambience was poor, we had no privacy and felt like we were being watched from both sides as it was a very crammed table area we were sat at.

Music was awful - I DJ myself and I can hear when mixing technique is poor. They would increase the volume on one song and fade the other out which meant that the music would just suddenly get louder, increasingly so that we couldn‚Äôt hear each other talk and enjoy the moment.

Food was incredible none the less, it did take ages to get our wine served and for the food to arrive however. It‚Äôs a shame although without it, this review would be 1*."

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,3,3,"Good, but far from the excellent experiences we‚Äôve had at the Jean Georges restaurants in New York. The New Year‚Äôs Eve menu was way overpriced."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,We had a great visit to Market and highly recommend it.  There were 5 of us and each truly enjoyed their meal.  Service was exceptional by the entire team.  We would all go back.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Alles super. Ich kann nur weiter empfehlen. Essen war super lecker. Service war hervorragend. Die Preise sind nicht billig. Aber es hat sich schon gelohnt.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,Outstanding evening - ginger margaritas are not to be missed.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Very good food for a reasonable price considering the location!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Recently dined at Market on our visit to Paris from London for two diners and was very impressed! The kind waiter was very attentive from the minute we arrived and brought us a conplimetary burrata with our starters of butternut squash soup and prawn skewers (both which were delicious). The main course followed with fillet steak which was also delicious and a chocolate cake for dessert which was outstanding! Was also served with some salted caramel ice cream on the house. Overall a great night, great service and food and the decor and ambience is great. Highly recommend!
Thank you to all the staff!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,4,3,"Das essen war atemberaubend.
Bei der Bar w√ºrde ich etwas mehr auf Hygiene achten und der Service muss an den englisch Kenntnissen arbeiten"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,1,5,3,"Came here with my husband for Christmas Day dinner. His pork chop was uncooked and he couldn‚Äôt even eat it. I ordered the ricotta ravioli and it was 4 raviolis over tomatoes sauce, I‚Äôve made better from ravioli in a box. Actually Trader Joe‚Äôs frozen ravioli bag has more flavor. Restaurant itself is beautiful, our waiter was friendly, but value and flavor of the meal were unsatisfactory, expensive for no reason. I do not recommend."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"This meal was a highlight of our trip and somewhat unexpected. We anticipated the food would be good, but were blown away by how good.  After a few days of heavier food, it was also very nice to have a few salad and lighter options that were just phenomenal.  Our pickiest eater had the ‚Äútomato, mozzarella, basil‚Äù pizza and cast aside the usual sauce aversion and loved the pizza. The desserts were also a hit from the sundae, to the lava cake, to the cheesecake."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,5,Nice place in an excellent location. The staff also very nice ans accesible.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,4,2,"It would be nice without Chartmusic Out of the speaker.
The food was good quality, but the ingrediens where midclass all in all. 
Its a shame, because the service where very frendly and trys to Help all the time."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,4,5,Beautiful presentation. Excellent food
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,2,4,"Understaffed for the Xmas eve occasion, so service was too slow but reactive when prompted.
Chicken meat was undercooked (!) in papillote.
The rest was excellent but overall too pricy."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Yellen was amazing, the absolute best service! My favorite restaurant in Paris, hands down! Can‚Äôt wait to go back. And get the cheesecake!!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"From the point we entered and until we left, we the hospitality and service were impeccable. The hosts, servers and managers made it an awesome experience. The food was delicious and we do plan to come back again!! Highly recommend this place."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,"We always enjoy eating at restaurants under the direction of Jean- George. We had great service from our lady server named Morgan. The chicken and coconut soup was extremely flavorful and tasty, and this may have been the best Thai chicken and coconut soup I have eaten, especially in Paris! We also enjoyed the black plate appetizer which had generous proportions of chicken samosas, crab rolls, tuna rolls, crispy salmon sushi, and shrimp saut√©. The crispy salmon sushi and the shrimp saut√© were my favorites, and my wife loved the chicken samosas. It was a great meal and a pleasant evening at the market by Jean George."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Gorgeous, loved the food, loved the place and had a lovely waitress, very attentive and chatty. Had the black plate and pizza, both delicious. Dessert was gorgeous too. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Paris"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"What a wonderful experience, food absolutely delicious  service was 1st class.  Highly recommended.  If in Paris again would definitely be visiting this restaurant."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Very nice restaurant in a nice part of Paris. Waiter was outstanding. Food was delicious.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"√âquipe toujours professionnelle et tr√®s chaleureuse
Un r√©gal pour tout. Merci

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,2,3,"Food good, team not to the level that it should be for such a high end venue.

Host at cloakroom, on phone and showed no interest. Couldn‚Äôt recommend where nearest metro was.

Waiter, inexperienced, friendly enough but no wow hospitality. Nice bday plate/dessert for my wife‚Äôs bday.

Chefs all mucking around when visiting the toilets and could be heard from the dining upstairs. Didn‚Äôt seem professional albeit looked immaculate.

Went to the Connaught JG and level of service was 10 x higher and more enjoyable.

Chipped crockery (stripped plates) on the table setting at arrival.

6/10 experience. To be fair an experience is just about ambience and service as the food quality."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Very nice menu and good food. We were happy with everything
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,5,3,It was ok but not amazing. The service was good and the staff are very friendly which is nice but the food didn't blow us away.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Yellen was amazing and food was as classic as always Jean Georges.

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Nous avons mang√© des entre√©s qui √©taient tres bonnes. Burrata, brochette etaient delicieux. Linguine etait moyenne. Je n'ai trouv√© la sauce trop citron√©. Nous √©tions 8 et notre table est situe√© dans un coin pas bruitant qui etait bien pour parler pendent le diner. Au total nous √©tions contents du dinner."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"So nice, we dined twice! This is a new favorite! Fresh, delicious food and drinks. They do everything well, from the preparation of the drinks and food to the service."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing service and delicious food!!

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,5,5,"Great place to go in Paris; upscale, delicious, great service, calming environment focused on the food. We have been here many times, often dining here when in Paris. A mistaken order on one of our mains (these things happen) was rectified graciously and swiftly. It was the only glitch in an otherwise perfect evening."

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Phenomenal food and service. A fantastic choice in walking distance of where we were staying in the 8th. The hosts couldn't have been more welcoming - receiving us with open arms from the rain. The waiter's amazing memory skills only added to the delectable dishes we chose. Loved it and the birthday fuss as fantastic and authentic!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,Delicious chicken samosas! And the chilli pasta linguine was also very tasty. Very grateful to staff for continuing to serve us drinks until long after kitchen closed. They were also good about letting us order food at 330pm when kitchen was closing. Much appreciated. Perfectly located; contemporary decor; accommodated a large party.  Will be back!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,5,Simply lovely! Staff amazing. Location great. Eiffel Tower can be seen from the entrance. Beautiful decor and the best Sancerre wine ever.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"My husband said this was the best meal he‚Äôs had in a restaurant in the past 30 years. I would have to agree.Everything was phenomenal .. the wine, the satay shrimp appetizer, the sea scallops, the broiled breem.. all outstanding!!  Warren, our server was gracious, knowledgeable and patient..  five stars all around!!"

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,3,4,"Food is very good. Service not so good. It looked like there was one person serving all the tables.  Ridiculous for such a high end restaurant.  There was other white stuff, but only one person that came to our table"

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I just spent 4 nights in Paris and this was by far the best meal I had. My cousin and I enjoyed every course. She ordered the steak and I had the scallops and both were outstanding. The chocolate dessert was sublime and the service was amazing.  We came here on our first night, and we wished we had time to come again during our trip. It blew away every other restaurant we went to. This was recommended to me by a friend, and I cant wait to recommend it to others. I will definitely be returning here on my next trip to Paris!"

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Absolutely outstanding in every way. Wish I had discovered this venue when I arrived to Paris a week ago. Beautiful restaurant with an imaginative menu and friendly staff. Will be dining at Chef‚Äôs restaurants in Miami and New York upon our return to the States. Whether you are in Paris for business or pleasure, this must be on your list for fine dining at extremely reasonable prices. And they make an excellent dirty martini!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,2,4,"The atmosphere is very nice, the place is impressive. Food was good not great. The value for the $ left a lot to be desired. We had about three different people coming to our table but none when we needed another drink. Not sure the staff identified themselves as waitress, server, manager at any point. I just know we saw each one once and then not again. Honestly, not worth the $"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,A hidden Gem. Excellent food and service; very nice patio and lovely spacious dining room. Easy to make a reservation last minute.

Staff was extremely nice, polite and helpful."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I found the restaurant via Open table and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. The service, food and ambience will be memorable! The manager,  Floren, and our server, Aiden, were AMAZING and made the entire experience wonderful.
We both ordered the lamb chops, but with sauces all on the side to be sure it was to our liking. The manager was patient and reassured us that we‚Äôd like it all put together. He was so right! Once we tasted separately, we had to combine the flavors which made the dish complete.
The peach cobbler with berries and homemade ice cream were perfect as well!
I will return to this restaurant on my next trip back to Paris!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Our server was superb.  The restaurant has a wonderful atmosphere.  The food was out of this world.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,I really wanted to celebrate my birthday here. And It was excellent I booked the last slot for lunch though it was difficult to find and we arrived a few minutes late they were most gracious. Catered to me and the kids. The meals and it‚Äôs  presentation was a delight each bite complimented the last. They even celebrated my birthday in French and English. Overall it was beyond. My expectations are met and exceeded
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,4,4,4,"delicious carpacio de Thon but alas the entree of turbot appeared as two small, very thin tail ends of the fish that were well overcooked and useful for re-soling my shoes. I compained but nothing happenedas a result - not even a regret -  which shows deep contempt for clinets by serving staff and breathtaking arrogance from the kitchen staff.

Neither of these things should detract from the good points of the restuaurant, but alas, they do. Massively. I hope themanager is listening intently as THIS WILL NOT DO."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The wait staff was incredibly helpful and friendly, and the food was delicious. The ‚Äúblack plate‚Äù was a must!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Second time here. And the food is always great, was busy this time so service was 4/5 but always a great experience. Will do it again next time in Paris. Two courses 3 drinks each around ‚Ç¨250"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,3,"The food was healthy and excellent.
The service is outstanding
Reataurant was very quiet as we went in the middle of august.
Great choice ! Would recommend"

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Our server was excellent, charming, friendly and knowledgeable."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,2,4,4,"In my opinion, foods are not authentic French style in this restaurant compared to other French restaurant. However, location and service were great."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,3,3,Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent food, very good cocktail. Service was attentive"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great experience! Our waiter was very friendly and served us very nicely
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,The food was great. Service attentive and not overdo.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,5,5,"We went to Market  by Jean-Georges for our anniversary. The ambiance was very nice and the service was excellent. The prices were a little high, especially the deserts, which started at $20. It was good but not large enough or that much better than another deserts we have had for much less. We started with the fried calamari which was nicely lightly breaded but was rubbery, not like good calamari I've had that melts in your mouth. My wife had the beef with white asparagus. The beef was cooked perfectly and was very good. The asparagus was half cooked just right and half over cooked. I don't know how you do that. I had the salmon and zucchini. Both were cooked just right and were very good."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent food, service, and ambience. Nice for a special occasion!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I've eaten at this J-G restaurant several times previously - as well as other restaurants  that he oversees.  This was likely the best meal that I've ever had in any of his restaurants.  I chose an appetizer and main course that are new to his repertoire and both were exceptionally great.  Service was professional, polished and friendly.  
I looked forward to this meal on my final evening in Paris - and this was the culinary highlight."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Made the perfect ending to our busy first day in Paris. Food was wonderful and service was fantastic. Our waiter, Cedric was attentive to our table and our son‚Äôs nut allergies. Chicken dish is one of the top 5 chicken dishes I have ever had. Great ambiance and kid friendly! Definitely would come back. Recommend highly!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,1,2,2,"Please improve the quality of your menu. Just having a big Chef‚Äôs name doesn‚Äôt do it. Service and quality are of great importance if you are placed at a strategic location. Paris is loosing its charm and it‚Äôs a real shame that France being the gastronomical capital of the world is not keeping up with its prestige made by earlier generations. Mind you having a name behind is only marketing not value to the food serves to the paying client. 

Mediocre ingredients, lacks standard and missing the French savoir faire."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,2,4,3,"The cheeseburger was $35.  The bun was fresh out of a grocery store bag, no toasting.  I would have expected much more at their prices."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,3,4,"Brought family here. First time in Paris for some of the family members and wanted to treat them to a great Parisian meal.
Sad to say was disappointed by the food and the service while friendly enough was slow and not very helpful or attentive.  Took forever to just get some butter for the bread.
Had better food and service at a regular French brasserie."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,2,2,"Diner extr√™mement  d√©cevant, nourriture tr√®s quelconque apr√®s pourtant une bonne exp√©rience l‚Äôann√©e derni√®re mais le chef √©tait probablement en vacances. Au d√©but du d√Æner il a fallu se lever chercher un serveur pour commander du vin, au fond de la salle on nous avait oubli√©"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent ingredients, perfectly cooked. Best ever calamari fritti - with parmesan and a spicy green sauce. Perfect poached egg for the eggs benedict. John Dory cooked perfectly, with crispy skin and a delicious habanero and lime sauce.
Prices a bit high, but pleasant ambience, very spacious."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I cannot say enough about this restaurant.  The food was incredible, as was the service.  They have an amazing wine list as well.  Do yourself a favor when you're in Paris and make the effort to dine here."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,We had a great experience. My wife and 2 kids went there for dinner. We ordered numerous plates and shared. All the food was delicious. It was a little non the expensive side but worth it. The sever was also very attentive and provided some good recommendations.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Our server Morgan was amazing and we really enjoyed our meal.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent as always, will come again for sure.

thanks very much"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,5,4,Great place with very nice staff. The food is always delicious. A little noisy sometime but you can easily get a table in a quiter area!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We had the most wonderful meal here the service we received from Morgane was outstanding and the food was sublime. Some may say this restaurant is a little expensive , however you are in Paris and we felt it was worth every Euro"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,3,5,Surprising and delicious. Creative and exquisite while also proposing Jean Georges‚Äôs classics. I am a big fan.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Booked this with the recommendation from our hotel. I got nervous after reading some of the reviews here. Don‚Äôt listen those people, they‚Äôre probably younger, spoiled, entitled idiots. Or maybe just old and grumpy, idk. I‚Äôm 40, from Los Angeles and have dined all over‚Ä¶ this place was fantastic! Took my daughter, she loved it. Our server, Aiden, was new and we would not have known; super helpful, friendly any attentive"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,1,2,1,What a joke ! Living and paris and knowing food   This is the worst of paris   I lived in nyc and went to jean George lots on Central Park west   And this one I s nothing like it.  What a shame !
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food was great. Cedric provided great service. Nice quiet dinner just off the hustle and bustle of CDL.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,3,1,2,"Jean George should either commit to having a great resteraunt in Paris , or just close it up
It hurts his brand , service was not knowledgable of menu , took 15 minutes before water was brought to table and resteraunt was half empty , we eat a lot on his NY Resteraunts and this is not fitting"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Wonderful tasty food. Fresh ingredients. Nice ginger margarita that tasted better than it sounds. Lovely contemporary decor. Good service, present but not overly hovering."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I went here for my birthday, the food & service was great! I would definitely go again."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,Excellent meal and service. Very helpful with choices in English.  Cocktails were fabulous.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,3,5,Food was ok. Service was slow.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,4,1,1,"Definitely not the Jean-Georges standard I expected!  His restaurant in NYC several years ago was superb.  I expected the same at Market in Paris.  It is not!  Definitely not fine dining.  Food was very good but not excellent.    4 tables with children.  1 table of children extremely loud while another table had a child who had brought a bottle of bubbles and was blowing bubbles during dinner. Wait staff at times appeared bored and aloof. One waiter was standing in the middle of the dining room scratching his eye repeatedly and then looking at his finger apparently trying to get something out of his eye - again, in the middle of the dining room.  To cap it off, my waitress disappeared at the end of our meal.  I asked another waiter to find her.  She still never showed up.  I then had to walk to the hostess stand to ask to pay.  They found my waitress outside on the sidewalk talking to someone as I could see out the front door.  Overall extremely disappointing.  A Saturday evening out in Paris turned into more Ronald McDonald than Jean-Georges."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,4,5,Chic and cool ambience with great food to match and an excellent Sancerre.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,4,4,"Overall good, not great.  Artichoke starter was tasty, but full of cooking oil.  Turbot was delicious and very well prepared, just slightly small portion.  Staff friendly and helpful.  Very nice wine selection and although the waitress wasn‚Äôt a drinker, made good recommendations.  I do feel it was a bit of a tourist trap and can‚Äôt to tell if the restaurant is trying to be more formal/upscale, but the other restaurant goers were not dressed as well as one would expect of a finer dining experience."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,4,3,2,"Nice food, excellent bred. Dishes are very good.
Price are somehow high (half a bottle of water ‚Ç¨ 10 for example).
Noise is an issue when the restaurant has many clients."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,4,5,Great atmosphere and wonderful food! Would definitely go back!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,We had an excellent waiter that was attentive and knowledgeable. The food was fantastic. We were there for a long time and they did not rush us. Over all definitely will come back next time in Paris.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"From The Hostess to our Server (forgot to get their names) but they treated us so well on our celebration for our engagement dinner. Love this place , the service , the ambiance (sade music is great) and the food cant forget those amazing dishes we had!  Will Always recommend to everyone! Thank you for all your hospitality"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,We had a great experience for dinner. The food was delicious and the service was excellent!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent meal and service. Overall a very good experience. I will come back!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,2,3,Service was poor waitress was clearly ready to leave she told us that we needed to hurry and order because the kitchen was closing soon although another party arrived well after us and took their time ordering and were not rushed by their sever.  They looked very comfortable and even had to prompt the server to get more drinks.  I was celebrating a birthday and they didn‚Äôt even acknowledge it although it was included on the reservation.  Food was okay but not worth the price and poor customer service.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Exactly what you would expect from JG. Inventive, well delivers and wonderful tastes."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,1,2,"Service took FOREVER, food meh, ambiance good, was hoping for more, wouldn‚Äôt recommend"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We arrived near closing time after a spontaneous change of dinner plans.  The staff was fantastic!  Very accommodating, including as we impulsively changed our table after ten minutes.

We didn't have a big appetite, so can't report on lots of dishes, but our apps and drinks hit the mark.

We love Jean-Georges' New York restaurants, and the hospitality, quality and ambiance of Market made it quite clear...we were in the warm and capable hands of a Jean-Georges team.

Chapeaux to GM Razoo and the staff...including one of our terrific servers, Cedric!  A welcoming experience, steps from the Champs!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,I‚Äôve eaten here several times - basically whenever I‚Äôm in Paris.  It‚Äôs a wonderful go to place to take first time visitors to the city - great food - great ambiance & service with a menu selection that can please ¬´¬†out-of-towners¬†¬ª especially business associates.  It‚Äôs in a great location close to Le Bristol for an elegant cocktail before or after.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,5,5,The wine list differs from the one on the web site. Couldn‚Äôt find most of the premium (grand cru) wines in selection. But food is exceptional!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Overal outstanding experience. Vegan options available.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The food and service were fantastic; I had crab rolls and the salmon roll appetizers, and then a nice piece of grilled fish for my entre. I‚Äôd dine there again when I return to Paris."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Amazing food and even better staff! Management greeted us and explained how they are the only ones in the city that make the Black Plate!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,2,1,4,Took 40 minutes for them to take a drink Ôøºorder and it was 2 hours total before our food arrived. Food over cooked
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Everything we ate was spectacular! This was my second time at a restaurant by Jean-George and he is the best! The food will not disappoint you
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,4,Muy bien realmente poca gente pero comida deliciosa
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,2,3,3,Das Essen ist nichts besonderes und die So√üen sind zu fade.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,4,3,"Unfortunately the food at this restaurant missed the mark.  The service and overall atmosphere was very nice but the food did not live up to the Jean George name.

First out calamari had to be sent back because it was over cooked.  Our pasta dish with pesto was not seasoned did not have enough pesto and the chicken we added was cooked until it looked like a crouton. Chicken and artichoke dish was not seasoned and chicken was over cooked, ravioli was cold and not seasoned lastly the lamb chops were decent but nothing special.

Hopefully they will make some changes going forward"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,3,1,3,Really slow service unfortunately. Almost an hour between courses. No follow up at table whatsoever. Food was average.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent wine selection to go with the delicious food. Manager came over and talked to us for a bit- even sent us two desserts for free since we drank and ate so much. Very nice staff and we will definitely return when we go back to Paris.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,The restaurant is very modern unlike the steak house at the aria when is decidedly French decor.  This restaurant is on a beautiful street in a beautiful city
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great experience! Manager Raju and wait staff very attentive and friendly

Food is excellent! Craft being maintained by chef.. NY to Paris some dishes tasted the same."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Highly recommend!!! Excellent service and delicious food!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Fantastic meal and great service, 5 of us ranging in age from 12 to 84 went and all really enjoyed it."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,1,2,"The restaurant was uncomfortably hot. They wouldn‚Äôt put on AC and said the door was open when we mentioned it (it wasn‚Äôt even). The food was distinctly average. The staff was aloof. And to top it all off they added 40 euros for no apparent reason. The bill just had the total without any itemisation. It was only when we asked for the breakdown that we noticed the extra item, which they promptly took off and said it was someone else‚Äôs item that went on our bill by mistake. No apologies or anything. Avoid at all costs."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,1,4,5,"Seemingly unpleasant to Americans. Lamb was raw/rare. Poor seasoning, asked us to order food before we were given drink menus. Atmosphere was good, location is good, food was below average."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing food and amazing service. Everything was wonderful, would definitely recommend and return again."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Very enjoyable meal. We shared several dishes and loved each one. They were very helpful with my gluten free requests. The food was fresh, well presented and delicious. Great cocktails, too. Would definitely recommend"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food was excellent. The wait staff was courteous. The drinks were great as well.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,3,The staff and food were beyond amazing! The only thing I could have wished for was more of an atmosphere.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Very fresh and excellently prepared food. Service was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. They were most accommodating our dietary needs (gluten and dairy sensitivities) and even provided very good gluten-free bread."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excelente ambiente, la comida deliciosa y muy buen servicio"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,2,4,4,"Friendly staff however food was not great, especially at the price. Had the crab roles (under cooked) and shrimp salad, creamy sauce was tastie but the vinegar, particularly on its own, was not good"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,4,"Starters fantastic, meal was good,
Omg loveeeeeddd the drinks, the cheesecake with sorbet was amazing! I‚Äôm definitely coming back."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,3,3,"They did not have a dish I wanted.
Service was not great
Allowed a child to scream in the restaurant t
Very pricey for what you get"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,5,5,"Food and Service were incredible, Ambience was very modern and felt worth the money. 

Only Letdown are prices for drinks, 9 Euros for a can of Sprite is too much, no matter the quality of the food. Cocktails were expensive aswell, mostly 18 Euros, the Mojito was still the best I ever had.

Overall I would still come again."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,4,3,Food overpriced for the quality of food. Had the crusted chicken and it was so dry I could hardly get through the meal.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,2,3,3,Nice place. Not the same quality of food as Jean Gorges restaurants in New York.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,3,3,"Lots of Americans, large menu but food was average at best.  They tend to use the same sauces on different dishes (pasta dish and chicken dish, for example) so everything tastes a lot the same. The wine list was extensive and not real expensive, but we didn‚Äôt stay for dessert since our expectations had been crushed.  We have eaten at several Jean-Georges restaurants in NYC, but this one does his reputation no favors."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excelente atenci√≥n de
Todo el personal, platillos muy bien presentados, buenos coctel, muy recomendable en Par√≠s"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,5,4,Service is outstanding. Food is very good. Great relaxed upscale atmosphere.

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We are visiting from American and found this restaurant on open table. My friend and I were very pleased. The food was great, the staff were friendly, and the ambiance was lovely. Would definitely recommend this place to others"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We ate at Michelin star restaurants and many other highly rated restaurants in Paris, but Market remained at the top of our list!
The tranquil but upbeat ambiance, lighting are a start. The service never disappoints. Kind, respectful, competent, anxious to please.

And, of course, the food.

I ordered the spiced crusted sea bream with sweet and sour broth, and crispy artichokes for both of my dinners!  The sea bream had a crispy skin, and delicate, moist mean - hard to achieve in a thin fish. And the broth was just the right quantity with a lovely not too spicy, not too sweet, interesting flavor.

For dessert, the last time, I ordered Mille-crepe br√ªl√©e au grand mariner, coulis de mangue et passion - this was the first time I ever tasted a dessert like this - different, delicate, just enough sweetness, but a texture to dream of. Like Mille but the texture of a delicate layered crepe."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Dinner for our last night in Paris.  Everything was magnificent!  Spectacular food and service!!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,Delicious food and very nice and attentive service

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Lovely ambiance and wonderful service/staff. The food was delicious too!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,1,4,"Fine ambiance and very good food. The chef is very successful. Food and presentation were very good, we liked all the dishes. 

However service was poor. Staff were arguing among themselves to not help each other. 
At the end of the night, the waiter brought the check but said he forgot to add the wine in the total sum, got the payment with added amount but the restaurant invoice didn‚Äôt show the final sum. We were uncomfortable with that."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Best meal we had in Paris.  Truly exceptional food and service. Every dish was wonderful.  So glad we did this it was literally one of the highlights of our trip.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,This place is a hidden gem. Our group of 9 had such a great experience so we went there two nights in a row.  Raju the general manager runs a well oiled machine.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,We enjoyed dinner at the market so much we came back with more people the next night! The food was delicious and the service was excellent.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Awesome restaurant, food, drinks, and staff. Well done!!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Das Essen war hervorragend. In der K√ºche war definitiv jemand, der wei√ü was er tut! Die Geschm√§cker waren inspirierend, der Service sehr aufmerksam, die Auswahl f√ºr glutenfreie Optionen war gut. Ein Empfehlung f√ºr alle die frz.-fusion m√∂gen. Getr√§nkeauswahl gut sortiert. Der Service war hingewandt und sehr aufmerksam. Kommen sehr gerne wieder!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"ein gemeinsamer abend mit freunden, das restaurant ist wundersch√∂n und extrem stylisch. im gegensatz zu vielen restaurants in paris hat man hier mehr als genug platz am und um den tisch! das essen war fantastisch, der service sehr aufmerksam und genau. die preise sind absolut ok. ein besuch lohnt sich!!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,Restaurant de qualit√©. Autant les produits que le service ou le cadre. Appr√©ciable pour Le Brunch le dimanche.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,1,2,"What once was a popular destination has devolved into a waste of time and money.  The menu is no longer imaginative, and the food preparation and service are abysmal.  Just skip it, and look for some place new.  This was beyond disappointing."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,3,3,Very good food with mediocre service. The crispi rice was excellent pasta with shrimp wow.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Greatest restaurant ever in Paris! We celebrate my husband‚Äôs birthday and have a great night thanks for the great service
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,One of the best meals we had on our stay in Paris. Get the Moulin Rouge cocktail!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent cuisine, wine, and hospitality. Looking forward to visiting again."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,3,4,5,Sushi salmon appetizer and drinks were terrific. Chicken entree was overcooked and dry. Salmon with champagne vinegrette Sauce was outstanding. And bread was delicious so fresh. Service good.

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,5,4,"The burger was good, chips a bit cool. My wife had the chicken which arrived as a chicken breast and that was about it. My daughter had the ‚Ç¨33 pizza, which was a bit smaller than a dinner plate. Not great value, you have to order extras to go with your meal,
Make sure you ask what will you receive food wise on your plate. Otherwise your get a lump of chicken.."

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The food here was fantastic. Our starters were the coconut curry chicken soup which was out of this world. My wife had the octopus which was cooked to perfection and as soft as butter, not overly chewy.  For dinner she had the salmon and I had the Lamb. Bothe were delicious.  Pretty full so we shared this dessert.  It was also fantastic."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,We we celebrating a birthday and the Market staff was very accommodating to my requests. Thank you.

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,My husband and I at here for dinner for our one night in Paris. Everything was exceptional. Definitely one of the best meals we‚Äôve ever had!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Outstanding food, service and experience."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,New Year‚Äôs Day dinner. Beautiful restaurant just off Champs Elysees. Great service and the food was tremendous - had the lamb was cooked to perfection.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,4,5,"We went for NYE and had the BEST time. Perfect location to view the fireworks at the Arc de Triomphe. The atmosphere of the restaurant was fun, the decorations were beautiful, and the food was fantastic. 

If you plan to spend New Year‚Äôs Eve in Paris, you MUST go to Market!!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Dinner was very expensive, but it was a new year's special menu. Everything else was excelent"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,5,2,5,They didn‚Äôt tell us before our visit that there was a new years eve package. So the only food available was the package that cost ‚Ç¨198.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Celebrated New Years Eve.  Fantastic experience.  Excellent good.  Very good service.  Fun and lively ambiance.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,4,The food quality was indeed very good although a bit too pricy. Overall staff were brilliant. Location was superb
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,5,3,Das Silvester Men√º ist viel zu √ºberteuert au√üerdem war es eine Abfertigung. Mit sch√∂n sitzen und genie√üen hatte es nicht viel zu tun
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,2,2,"Coconut chicken soup is amazing by taste and we really loved it. This soup recipe is very interesting and I definitely try to incorporate it in my cooking as well.

Fried calamari, very banal and basic as cooked and tasted, but the green sauce with yogurt, cumin, lemon juice and etc is very interesting.

Salmon, well it was skinned (bad!) and tasted as farmed Atlantic poor fish raised in a tank without sunshine and vitamins. üòä Its spice coating and sauce are good, but poor fish structure barely survived defrosting and was mashy. Would send back dish as such in San Francisco.

Parmesan chicken. Well. It's was so dry. Plastic cheap chicken. Disgusting. Shame on the cook. Artichokes were well cooked and in nice sauce.
I was expecting totally different dish. It's was not even comparable to NYC street deli chicken cutlet. Yesterday was New Years eve and I just didn't want to spoil out mood by complaining. But to serve the chicken as such is high crime in culinary industry and sous-chef who is responsible for it should be sentenced to few years in only veggie cutting enclosure.
What you never heard about free range and organic chickens in Paris?

Table near us, one person had Angus Beef hamburger with Russian dressing. Oh boy. Looks so cheap and dry with those ugly fries. Maybe in Paris it's exotic food. lol the French man had to dissect the hamburger and scoop away the meat. I don't blame him, I will do the same. The bun was clearly not eatable.

The tap water somehow comes up as 9++euros on bill and there is a no way to know what they charge for any drinks including water and etc.

I been at Jean-Georges places before and I met the chef at San Francisco Design Center around my former gallery. Definitely below my expectations and won't recommend this place. After all, there are still great restaurants in vicinity in Paris, France to get your palette quite happy about.

Happy New Year üéâ"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,4,5,Tr√®s bonne adresse. Je recommande le cheesecake vraiment succulent.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"All the staff here are so friendly, they‚Äôre attentive and cannot do enough to make the experience a memorable one. The waiters here made the experience even better as they engaged with us on a personal level and their customer service was first class. The food was exquisite and definitely worth coming back to Paris for! Amazing experience from start to finish, c‚Äôest magnifique!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,4,This was another last minute reservation and glad I made it.  Was seated at the bar dining area and it was comfortable.Tried the shared black plate for entree and the turbot for main.  Shared black plate was exceptional and the turbot was solid.  Service was as you‚Äôd hope for and my waiter was attentive and always ready. Will be booking again :)
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,5,3,3,"Excellent food, service level average: 3 mistakes really is too much.
Bad music much too loud.

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Superb meal in a great vibrant restaurant. The manager leaves his team superbly and compliments to the chef. A must for all ages
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,2,4,An hour and a half wait for the main course.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Nice dinner and great service.  They were flexible enough to make minor ingredients changes to accommodate for my vegan daughter.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great Christmas dinner meal lots of amazing tastes (everyone chose their mains) and great desserts at the end.  Would absolutely go there again.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"‚ÄúA Flavor Bonanza!!‚Äù

We have a fantastic dining experience at Market for our Christmas  celebration. We started off with Tuna tartare, burrata, and the perfectly dressed kale salad. All of the starters were flavorful and the perfect size to share.

At the suggestion of our servers Yelen and Morgane, we chose the lamb chops as our main course and they were incredibly tender and paired perfectly with the mushroom bolognese.

The impeccable service and upbeat atmosphere in the restaurant made for a great family celebration! Yelen and Morgane are very knowledge about their menu and they made the evening so much fun!!!

I highly recommend this restaurant for a special evening."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,From the food to the staff everything was perfect. Wine was great. Food was absolutely delicious. Would definitely recommend the restaurant is worth every price.

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,5,2,3,"Extremadamente cara la cena de navidad 150‚Ç¨ persona, 4 Plat√≥s de buena calidad pero sin valor superior de 15 euros cada uno. No inclu√≠a vino ni agua"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,4,1,1,"El servicio es muy lento, nos dieron una mesa muy mal ubicada, les ten√≠a que rogar para que me sirvieran una copa de chapagne, la comida es buena pero definitivamente no regresar√≠a por el p√©simo servicio"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,5,5,"The service is wonderful, from the hostess to the maitre d' to the server, but the food was disappointing especially for the price.
The bread was tasteless and too tough.
The calamari was tough and chewy.
The steak was not seasoned, it smelled gamey, and it was a little tough.
The ravioli was too firm and a little on the bland side. Some parts of the ricotta was cold, it seemed like it was previously frozen.
The wine was great and Matias, our server was the saving grace."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Helene was our waitress
She is a beautiful person that loves people and her job
She has proposed cocktail that was really excellent gin with cucumber and martini ( not to miss it)
The salads fresh and very well prepared
Our burgers delicious with french fries and disonnaise mustard very tasty
The ambiance really good a rainy night instagrammable you cabbsay

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,3,4,Seit Jahren h√§llt das Restaurant seine Qualit√§t. Jedes mal wenn ich in Paris bin ist das Restaurant ein Muss. Die Qualit√§t und die Pr√§sentation des Essens ist top. Immer wieder.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Food was fantastic, best meal we've had in our two weeks in France."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,3,2,Basically really expensive airplane food! Awful! Staff was polite.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,4,3,3,"Eclectic cuisine. The restaurant offers some interesting fusion dishes.  Modern venue.  Service is ok, but portions were sightly too small (we had scallops) compared to burgers that were served to next table."

Personal and service so as the food were just perfect.
We certainly come back as soon as we are in Paris.
Thank you so much!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,Great spot.  Reminiscent of the old Spice Market restaurant in NYC by JG
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,2,4,3,"Ce restaurant a √©norm√©ment baiss√© , les prix sont tr√®s √©lev√©s tous les plats que nous avons command√©s √©taient insipides et de mauvaise qualit√© l artichaut ti√®de √† 19‚Ç¨ est sans int√©r√™t les coquilles Saint Jacques toutes simples √† 32‚Ç¨ un v√©ritable scandale vu la taille seule le cheesecake vaut la peine et je ne parle pas du blanc de poulet qu on recouvre de parmesan pour masquer la m√©diocrit√© du produit

Je ne retournerai plus"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,2,2,3,"Pizza served on a piece of paper ( not sure if they left it by mistake) , had to remove it,. Then I struggled to cut the pizza, dough was hard  like a rock ! How you can go wrong with a simple plain cheese pizza is hard to understand . The order for the 3 guests took too long . Nice place but disappointed by the food and service . Not the same as it was several years ago ."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Simply perfect! Lovely greeting upon arrival. Our server was wonderful and knowledgeable. Everything we orderer was sublime. Loved the ambiance. Such a lovely night! Will return when I‚Äôm back in Paris and will share with friends.  Bravo!

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,3,1,3,"The service was very slow but the food came out very quickly, not a good sign. While we were eating our artichoke that was undercooked a live spider crawled out of it, when we presented it to the waiter she called over the manager that was hardly apologetic and said he would remove it from the bill. That‚Äôs it no complementary dessert, drinks nothing. The only thing the manager would say it that he washed the artichoke himself. Crazy for a Jean George establishment in the city of lights it was super underwhelming and way over priced at over $120.00 per person"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,4,Reasonably priced and nice vibe. Great location. Service was pleasant but adequate. Would go again
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,3,3,1,"Cuisine de bonne qualit√© sauf le blanc de poulet en croute de parmesan dur, sec et sans int√©r√™t, niveau sonore insupportable. on vient diner dans un restaurant pour pouvoir se parler normalement dans une ambiance cosy apr√®s une semaine √©prouvante et on se retrouve dans une atmosph√®re o√π les clients sont oblig√©s de parler tr√®s fort pour couvrir la boite √† rythme que nous impose le restaurant. Service un peu lent."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,5,4,Excellent food. The salmon was one of the best i have had  My wife had the risotto and it was very good. The service was good. The price of Whisky was ridiculously expensive. Overall it was a good experience
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,4,5,Great meal.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,2,2,"We used to love Market and came at each one of our bodies to Paris - we were nostalgic and came afin. The food was mediocre at best (some dishes excruciatingly spicy with chilis that were not described to be in the dish on the menu). Portions were small too snd service not particularly attentive even though the restaurant was not full 

I will not come back ‚Ä¶ very sad"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,5,Another Jean-George hit!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Delightful recommendation by Open table. Visiting France with my two besties. Amazing service and food!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,5,1,3,"It is a pity the service was painfully slow and confused.  We received a menu 12 minutes after seating.  20 minutes later our drink and food order were taken together.  Our cocktails came out 14 minutes after the salad.  The salad sat while we waited for and enjoyed our cocktails.  The main course, as you would expect, was beautifully presented, creative and delicious.  We did not get dessert because our waitress was much too slow and confused.  This was unfortunate because I was looking forward to the passion fruit mousse.  Nothing but Americans here so the vibe is more like Los Angeles."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived for our reservation.  The modern soft rock playing over the speakers provided a for an upbeat atmosphere.  The decor is modern.  Great choice of cocktails and I recommend the Cucumber Martini.  Wine selection is good.  The food offers many choices and is very eclectic with fantastic flavors.  Service was excellent!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Very delicious meal - a lot of variety on the menu and gracious and friendly service - I would return with pleasure - buzzy vibe for a casual meal with friends

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,2,1,3,Overpriced; terrible service. Staff not attentive at all. Average food. Kept waiting 20 minutes to have the bill. Quiet disappointing for a Jean-Georges restaurant. I was expecting a lot more.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Our waiter and food were both amazing. Wish I recalled his name to compliment him!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Nice place, excellent service and amazing food!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great food and excellent service. Many thanks Warren!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent fish and their deserts are to die for especially the crepes. Would love to see a vegetarian pasta dish instead of the raviolis that are average.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Accueil souriant et service au petit soin. Le tout, dans un cadre sympa. Nous nous sommes r√©gal√©s."

Go Go Go"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Food, ambience and service were 5 stars! our waiter was friendly and we really enjoyed all plates he recommended"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,3,1,3,"Visually pleasing restaurant with incredibly slow and inattentive service. Menu is over-priced for small portions of very average food.  We were given a sharing dessert ""on the house"" as it was our wedding anniversary - only to find that it had been added to our bill when we came to pay (it was only removed from the total when I drew this to the server's attention). Neighbouring table (a mum and child) went to the lavatory and returned to find that their table had been cleared by a trainee waiter. For just over 200 Euros it was a very poor dining experience in a City full of good restaurants."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,4,4,Dinner was amazing and service was superb and the cheesecake was delicious!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,4,4,"Open table suggest this is a mid price option but it‚Äôs closer to top end. Our meal for 2 was 250 Euros with a single bottle of their cheapest wine. 

You‚Äôll get a top end environment and good service but while the food is very good it just doesn‚Äôt have enough about it  to make it special or justify the prices."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"It was magnificent, thank you for the lovely evening!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food was excellent along with the service. Don‚Äôt usually leave reviews but this was one of our favorite meals in Paris by far.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food and service was excellent!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,2,1,3,"Very underwhelming food. We expected a lot more. The menu is pretty chaotic, and kind of just seems like a random group of items just thrown together.  We ordered 4 dishes from the ‚Äúshareable‚Äù section but for no clear reason they split 2 of these in half and put on separate plates. The tuna tartare was excellent and the ginger sauce was at least a little unique. The ‚Äúcrispy rice‚Äù salmon nigiri was a huge miss in terms of execution but also just didn‚Äôt seem like a good idea anyway. The shrimp salad was fine but the shrimp being hot on a cold salad was also kind of weird, and it clearly would‚Äôve been better chilled. The calamari was also fine but a bit too chewy, and for a restaurant of this supposed caliber I expected way more. The biggest miss by far was the octopus which was pretty bad. Seemed like they boiled it, then fried , then grilled it hard. It was past charred jn spots and instead just tasted burned. 
Food aside, the service was just terrible. Spoke to our waiter 4 times total, and 2 of those we had to flag him down. The bartender actually finally brought us the check after the waiter forgot. I ordered a beer then when I finished it he just took my glass and didn‚Äôt ask if I wanted another. Took 10 minutes to realize he wasn‚Äôt coming back so I went to the bar and ordered a beer."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,1,4,"Tr√®s cher pour la qualit√© des mets
Portions tr√®s l√©g√®res
Th√© servi avec environ 10ml d'eau. Pour 9‚Ç¨ ca fait tr√®s cher la gorg√©e."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,If you are in Paris and want a top class restaurant you must visit here. The food in outstanding as is the service you might think it‚Äôs a little expensive but you get what you pay for. We had the Black Plate to start and it was out of this world. If I lived in Paris I would be a poor man because I‚Äôd eat here all of the time.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, pairings, atmosphere, drinks - a must visit!!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,Wonderful food and service. We brought our kids and the staff was very attentive.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Love this restaurant!! If in Paris it is well worth making time time to dine here! The food is excellent and the service some of the best in Paris.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,1,2,"Such a disappointment! I have been to Market a few years ago and this visit was nothing like the previous one. Our waiter only spoke to us when we ordered and when he inquired about dessert. Although the inside of the restaurant only had guests at 4 other tables, the service was extremely deficient. The food was pretty good but not what you‚Äôd expect from Jean Georges."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,4,Excellent service. The food was very good -- we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,3,2,3,"Complete tourist trap.  Avoid at all cost.  We were seated promptly and waited about 15 minutes with menus closed on the table for our waiter to visit the even though there were only about six tables in the upstairs dining room.  I ordered Tuna Tartare for a starter and the Duck for my entree.  Portions were small but the sauces were excellent, by far the most impressive aspect of the meal.  My wife ordered Gazpacho to start and the Risotto.  Again, the sauce was the star.  My teenage daughter ordered a pizza.  When asked how it was, she replied ‚Äúit‚Äôs alright‚Äù‚Ä¶a 14 year old food critic who nailed the chefs performance in as few words as possible.  If we hadn‚Äôt suffered through enough mediocrity, we dared to order desserts.  This is where I was shocked and appalled beyond words; I ordered the chocolate cake after inquiring about the ‚ÄúCrepe Br√ªl√©e‚Äù and not being impressed in the slightest with the description‚Ä¶my wife ordered the Pavlova.  The chocolate cake arrived and to my horror, I had just received a Chocolate Lava Cake that you might expect to get at TGI Fridays for bargain price of 16 Euros.  You‚Äôve got to be absolutely kidding me.  The chef should be embarrassed to serve anything like that in a city with what are arguably some of the best patisseries on the planet right around the corner from his front door; and for 16 Euros besides.  Absolutely shameful.  My wife took a few bites out of the Pavlova and was thoroughly unimpressed.  I tasted it and although it wasn‚Äôt terrible, it certainly was less than memorable.  We waited another fifteen minutes after the table had been cleared before hailing the waiter for the check.  So, in short: service - mediocre, food - okay, sauces - excellent, desserts - a disgrace.  I would not dine here again if you paid me nor would I recommend to anyone."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,3,4,4,The services was good. The manager always checking on the service and good.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,4,5,Overall a good experience thanks to the manager who intervened and assisted for the evening.  Food was good and cocktails nicely made.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,3,4,Food was very good. Service was a bit slow.  We did go later in the evening so it wasn't too busy.  Expensive.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,3,1,2,"The poor service drove the overall rating down. Really, really bad service.  Food was, at best, good, but both salads were overdressed.  Clientele was near 100% from the U.S. which tells me the locals don‚Äôt place much value here."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,4,"I have been at Market several times before the Pandemic. This time it was a good experience, but fell a little behind in expectations. Menu was not as innovative as in the past. Wine BTG with very few options. Service was attentive by the server."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Generally, this is a moderately upscale restaurant that you might find in the US.  Does not have a true Paris feel, but is safe bet for tourists looking for good food in an environment that welcomes English speakers.  Clean, attractive restaurant with good service and solid (not spectacular) food."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,One of the better Jean Georges places I‚Äôve been to - everything about the evening was spot on !
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Lovely!  Great food and friendly staff!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,3,2,3,"The food was good but not at the level of my dinner in March. This was my second time at the restaurant. I was very impressed in March but not this time 
The price was higher, service was not as good. Very disappointed!! Would not recommend it"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Incredible!!! Traveling from the states and this far this is our favorite spot. Food was superb, our waiter was very attentive to detail, noticing our wine bottle wasn‚Äôt chilled enough he sent it back then proceeded to keep it at the perfect temperature all night long! Very friendly, cool space, welcoming of us Americans with our poor French. Can‚Äôt recommend this more!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food and service Was excellent! A bit pricey
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,This place is unbelievable. Only drawback and I mean only drawback is it doesn‚Äôt have a view of the Eiffel Tower or some other landmark. The Burrata with Fruit and the crab cake starters were incredible. Main course options were plentiful and the desserts should not be passed up.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Compliments to the chef, I don't eat mushrooms and last night I had two of the most delicious dishes I have ever had and both had mushrooms in them. I could not believe my taste buds!! Fantastic staff as well, friendly, attentive to detail and great communication.  Market will be a must go anytime we visit Paris!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,1,1,Underwhelming and extremely overpriced! 29 euros for bland tomato linguini and 70 euros for a starter platter with nothing special! We left after 40 minutes feeling utterly disappointed. The decor and music were pretentious  and the waiters completely inattentive who just focused on rushing us to order. Not worth it when in Paris - a city full of amazing restaurants.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"First time to Paris, so nothing better to dine at a Jean-Georges restaurant. Great location and walking distance to the Champs E lysees‚Ä¶Fun & friendly staff"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,2,3,"The seating area is nice but the food is not.
Not that the staff was being rude but they just don‚Äôt have good service."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Birthday meal with family. Superb evening, great choice of food and brilliant service."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Very good food, tasty and nicely presented, the waiter was quick and efficient yet very polite, and they even presented us with a small birthday cake on the house...

Only thing that could improve is the acoustics - it is very loud."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I was looking for a high quality meal relatively close to my hotel and found this restaurant on OpenTable. Next time I‚Äôm in  Paris I will absolutely return. The quality of the food was outstanding with absolutely perfect presentation. I especially recommend the ‚Äúcrepes br√ªl√©e‚Äù for dessert. It had multiple layers of crepe, each covered in a thin coating of custard, served with an apricot reduction sauce."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food was absolutely delicious and beverages were excellent. Highly recommending this restaurant.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,2,2,"La ubicaci√≥n est√° excelente pero la comida y el servicio dio mucho que desear. 

Cualquier Brasserie est√° mejor"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,4,5,Service un peu lent mais tr√®s attentionn√© et aimable
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We ate at Market on consecutive evenings this week.  This first night was our 4 year Anniversary and it was excellent.  The people are warm and inviting, smiling and laughing.  Our meals were excellent with the turbot and chicken breast as entree‚Äôs and a nice bottle of wine.  The next night was our last in Paris and we were able to get a table at Market!  It was even better!  We started with the Black Plate and it was absolutely amazing!  The salad was so good my wife ordered it as a main and we split that with the risotto.  Coupled with a beautiful Chateau Margaux, and you have another perfect evening!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Loved the atmosphere and the food
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,2,4,"Jean-Georges should be embarrassed‚Äî I came in thrilled and left horrified. Simply put, the chef needs to learn how to cook a steak medium rare, something that is honed at the age of 10.
Hey it happens, I get it ‚Äî but they took my steak back, threw it under the broiler and reserved me the same steak??UNACCEPTABLE!  For Jean-Georges?   An average restaurant that would be closed in 6 months in NYC.  Don‚Äôt bother"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Really good food and outstanding service!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Outstanding.  Food was amazing  Ginger Cosmo was so freaking good.  Service was outstanding.   Will be back
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Restaurant tr√®s agr√©able. Le cadre l‚Äôambiance le personnel, l‚Äôaccueil la nourriture tout est parfait pour passer un moment inoubliable."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,4,4,Overall it was a good experience but the food was not as good as we expect from a Jean Gorges restaurant. 1st course was good. Main course of crusted chicken was bland and without inspiration‚Ä¶
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,4,5,Wonderful place for French cuisine!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,2,5,"Maybe they are short staff, the service was not good.  Had to call a sever over five times during dinner."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,1,4,Not enough staff. Food was average.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,5,4,"We were a group of 7. Service was excellent. The food well presented and tasty but not exceptional. Great ambience, but a tad noisy for the hard of hearing! Recommend."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great quality lunch with superb service. Their green asparagus starter was delightful and their 16+ layer crepes desert yummy. It‚Äôs a reliable place to eat. Would go back and back.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,2,3,Disappointing for a JG restaurant. Service very slow and food not amazing
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,1,5,The manager was super friendly but the waitress had a terrible attitude. Food ok. The place was amazing.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Very nice seafood/fusion new restaurant near the base of the Champs √âlys√©es. Welcoming, everyone speaks English and most of the diners within earshot of me were from the US. Excellent food. Not much of a view for the few outside tables but the inside ambience is nice."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Outstanding service, highly recommend!
Thank you for an excellent evening."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,4,3,"Bel endroit bien situ√© ambiance calme. Une cuisine qui pourrait √™tre un peu sup√©rieure sur certains plats, notamment le pain des hamburger pas du tout √† la hauteur."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,3,4,Food was amazing very expensive but good
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent dinner! Great service. Highly recommend for a phenomenal meal in Paris!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Loved it! Food, service impeccable"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Our server Cedric was very helpful and attentive. There was a bit of wait for our table, even with our booking, but we weren‚Äôt too fussed. The food was delicious! Highly recommend the truffle pizza and the steak! The cocktails were really good and unique! Definitely would recommend."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Une tr√®s belle soir√©e d'anniversaire dans le restaurant Market ! 
Des plats d'une qualit√© exceptionnelle avec beaucoup de saveurs, un service irr√©prochable, nous y retournerons √† coup s√ªr !"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,5,2,3,If they put the same effort into their service as the food this place would be perfect. Really slow service but when the food eventually comes it is delicious.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Superb location in central Paris and excellent service from the staff. Exceptional food.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,4,2,"The food was truly wonderful and the service appropriate for a restaurant of its caliber.  But we were seated near a party of about 16-20 people who were celebrating something.  They were loud.  And their noise was supplemented by percussive piped in music.  Plus the architecture heightened the noise: lots of wood walls and glass windows, tiled floor with no carpet. This drift into US bad-hospitality culture in a restaurant created by Jean-Georges Vongerichten in France is sad.  We'd like to go back, the food and wine was so good, and the staff tried to make our visit pleasant.  But we need to know that changes have been made."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We came to visit Paris for vacation and came to Market based on online reviews and the ability to book a reservation. The food was DELICIOUS!!! The ambiance was sexy with the dimmed lights and good music. The service was excellent! We had salmon, a crab cake, calamari, the angus burger, shrimp salad, warm chocolate cake with ice cream, and the lemon ginger cake and sorbet! You will not be disappointed with your meal or dining environment."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Delicious food, great cocktails, staff made wonderful wine recommendation. A little pricey but overall wonderful experience."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Excellent service, food really good, order a pizza ti share as starter (avoid the pasta, stick to French options) the duck was delicious, dessert caf√© gourmand is perfect for sweet ending. Love the ambiance trendy and chic!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Nice cocktails, warm welcome, relaxed modern restaurant with good food and service."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,One of the most outstanding dining experiences which was definitely one of the highlights of our Paris trip! The food was an absolute delight and a perfect mixture of Asian & French cuisine. And to top it off the  ambience in the restaurant was lovely and the restaurant itself was beautiful. Also a big thank you to the owner of the restaurant for going above and beyond to make it such a memorable evening! Would definitely recommend as a place you have to try and I will definitely be back in the future!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,5,4,Excellent service by Morgan and the manager? Starters and appetisers as well as deserts were fantastic
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"fantastic fusion experience. Calm, modern and sophisticated atmosphere."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent restaurant. Beautifullly decorated. My tuna tartare over avocado with ginger was outstanding.My wife‚Äôs grilled Salmon was also excellent. Euro Asian influence
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,Food and service were amazing!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,3,5,5,"Nice ambiance, friendly staff but the food was okay and a bit overpriced.  

I would come back to drink a glass of wine with the the shrimp satey. That was really good."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,1,2,En esta oportunidad no bien .
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Nuestra experiencia fue fantastica. El lugar es agradable. La atenci√≥n del personal (especial Warren) fu excelente y la comida muy buena en calidad, sabor y cantidad
En resumen muy recomendable y sin dudad una excelente opci√≥n si est√°s en Paris y quieres comer bien."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excelente lugar.
Magnifica atenci√≥n y un gran servicio.
La cocina estupenda."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,2,5,4,The food was quite bland which I found surprising yet upsetting since I had always been blown away by Jean Georges other restaurants and cookbooks. Last time I was here (2019) it was way better.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Me encanto! El servicio es excelente! El ambiente es muy tranquilo. La comida deliciosa!!! Si lo recomiendo
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,4,4,"Excellent seafood. The manager checked on us periodically, too."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excelente servicio
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Good good and service
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,What a great dinner with friends
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,5,3,4,"Big mistake on the check which we realised later. ( something like a 45 euros mistake) 
And the prices on the menu on your website are not the true ones at the restaurant 

Food is good  of course.  Jean Georges is really talented and makes the best tartar de thon in the world. But the burger is disappointing. The bun should be softer and not fall in pieces‚Ä¶ for 32 euros

Service ok but not perfect"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The roast duck was incredible, the skin perfectly crispy and fatty. The warm chocolate (lava) cake was the perfect way to end the meal."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Fresh, adventurous, and interesting food‚Ä¶. The service from the staff was 1st class‚Ä¶. The team-working was incredible‚Ä¶. Everyone knew what you wanted, they were thinking ahead of you all the time‚Ä¶. My 14year old daughter even commented how good they were! 

Let‚Äôs not forget the cocktails! Sooooo good‚Ä¶.

5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è easy!!!! 

Thank you for making a great night!!!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,3,3,We were very disappointed with the food. The menu was expensive but the quality of the dishes we ordered did not warrant such high prices. In particular our main course the chicken in a Parmesan crust was dry and under seasoned with a watery source and in no way was worth the 35 euro price tag. If you are going to charge top dollar prices the food has to deliver but Market didn‚Äôt deliver at all. All in all a very disappointing and expensive experience
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Couldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant more. Outstanding food, excellent service.
Overwhelming."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Birthday date celebration
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, kind service. The restaurant is beautifull."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Really great service and really good food.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Very stylish place with excellent food and friendly waiters. We would highly recommend this restaurant.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Excellent food, fantastic wine, a quality experience all around."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Simply lovely would highly recommend for couples or families.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,2,4,The restaurant was modern and clean. The hostess was pleasant and then it went downhill from there. It took 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge we were even there and then it took even longer to get water. Ordered a martini and the small martini glass was a quarter full. The food was ok. Sambusa was good.  The risotto was not good. The highlight was the salmon and that‚Äôs not saying much. The dessert never came until we asked for the check. Then they brought the chocolate cake which tasted like flower. Jean George you better visit this place and get it together.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"It‚Äòs been absolutely perfect:
Great service, delicious food and beautiful atmosphere.
Highly recommend this awesome place. Happy to come back regularly."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,The Waiter (I think he was maybe he was an Owner) was AWESOME!!!  They were very tentative and the food was amazing.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We last ate at Market on a trip to Paris in 2002. It was fabulous then and is still fabulous twenty years later! Fantastic food, great staff and sat outside on a perfect Parisian spring day made for a memorable occasion. We will be back!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,5,4,"Visit did not start well when I was informed that half the single malt list, inclusive of every one I would drink, was unavailable. 
After that, the meal progressed on a more upbeat note. The food was delicious and the gateau I had for dessert was one of the best desserts ever... Any kind.
This restaurant is definitely worth a visit."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Incredible.  The tartare and cod were spectacular.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,1,4,3,"This place was a big disappointment. Our waiter was phenomenal, but the problem was that they kept seating him tables. I counted that he had 10 tables at one time. I‚Äôm sorry, no matter how good of a server you are 10 tables will drown you. The staff did nothing to help him out until one of his tables he couldn‚Äôt get to in a timely matter walked out. The wait for food was awful. Other tables who ordered well after we did got their food before us. The food was super high priced, small portions for the price, & BLAND! The manager did comp 2 of our meals, but man taste your food. Giving me watered down mayo on my shrimp salad & think that‚Äôs good is ü§Ø. The food looks pretty, but it wasn‚Äôt tasty. Thank goodness our cocktails & wine were good."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Our experience at Market was amazing! We came here for brunch for my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday and the service was excellent they were all lovely and professionnal. They even offered a birthday cake it was just perfect! I highly recommend food was great and very well presented! We will come back
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"A lovely restaurant, a contemporary, airy space. Delicious food in generous portions and wonderful service. Will definitely go again."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,5,They were great to accommodate us. We took our 11 year old and 5 year old. The food and service were great. At the end of the night our 5 year old son knocked a metal table and it made a loud noise - he started to cry and someone from the staff brought us all chocolates to cheer us up! Amazing time! Thank you!!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We really enjoyed our meal. Very friendly staff. Our waitress was very attentive. The food was excellent, varied menu. I choose a very nice cocktail. We would highly recommend"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"All was great, it was our first time at Market and we were treated as regulars, we will definitely return!!!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,5,5,"Aesthetically, the food looks great! Service is superb. Ambiance is soft and romantic. Cocktails were good. Food is ok - lacking the flavor I expected."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"busy trendy restaurant in a great part of town.
service was exceptional, food was delicious
possibly a little over priced and the 'sharing plates' are not really for sharing!
dinner for 3 + 1 bottle of wine, ‚Ç¨275"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Toujours aussi bien ! Service attentif et sympathique , des plats d√©licieux et parfait dans ce magnifique d√©cor de Liaigre qui traverse le temps sans prendre une ride. 
Un incontournable"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,We found Market through Open Table and had no idea it was a Jean-George restaurant. We came in with no real expectations but left truly happy and satisfied The meal was excellent - the wine choices equally so and the service was truly lovely. We will definitely return next time we are in Paris.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Good food, good service!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,1,3,Nourriture sans recherche et go√ªt √©trange et vinaigr√©. Service exag√©r√©ment d√©contract√©. Addition sal√©e. A √©viter √† tout prix!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,5,4,Je ne suis jamais d√©√ßu au Market on est bien re√ßu le service est parfait et la qualit√© du repas est toujours √©gale un petit moins la portion de la daurade toute simple est vraiment pour un petit enfant sinon rien √† dire
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,4,4,"The atmosphere is really good with the dim lighting. However I am not too thrilled with her food. The food looks good but the taste is really so so for Paris's standard.  The service is good so that was pleasant. 
There are many more better food quality and good atmospheric restaurants in Paris for the same price range. Therefore I think the value is quiet low."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,3,1,4,"In fairness - they seemed to have an event in the background and be understaffed. Nevertheless, this was a really disappointing meal with very little value for the high price point. The food was just alright and the portions were very small. I got the chicken and my friend got the burger. Neither of us were pleased with our meals but we were pretty hungry so just decided to eat and call it a day. 

I wouldn‚Äôt come back here. The service was also lacking, slow, and felt standoffish."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,4,Vlotte service en
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent refined food, selection of fish dishes especially notable. Excellent attentive service. A wonderful experience, consistent with experience from 2 years ago!"

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The best meal we had during our stay in France and we‚Äôve been here for 3 weeks! Our servers (Florin and Yelene) treated us really well! It was my girlfriends birthday and they made the occasion really, really special, the food was impeccable and the wine was great too. 10/10 on all fronts, highly recommend!

We‚Äôll definitely be coming back during our next visit!"

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wonderful. The staff was superb! Warm and welcoming
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Flurin was our server and his recommendations were spot on! We had the Tuna spring rolls as appetizer, the beef and scallops as main and cheesecake and volcano with ice cream for desserts. 

Everything was delicious!!! Outstanding! The service was great too. The place is a little bit pricey, our check was ‚Ç¨200 for 2 us and each one had 2 drinks. So definitely not a place for us to go everyday, but it will definitely recommend visiting for a special ocasi√≥n or if you are in the mood for delicious food."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent food and even better staff. Would recommend highly
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We had a wonderful experience here . Table for 6 was booked - when we arrived we were ushered to the best table in the room in a small alcove - almost a private dining experience . Excellent service , excellent food - overall a super night !"

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,My first time in Paris. The food and service were excellent. I was mostly on my own and I don‚Äôt mind dining alone. The staff was very attentive. I would definitely go back when I return to Paris!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We had a lovely meal, everything was delicious (kale, broccoli salad was a standout) and the ambience and service were top notch.  We highly recommend Market and would dine there again gladly."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Staff was very friendly. Food was excellent. All staff spoke English!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,5,4,Was a great experience and our waiter was fabulous. The dessert on tasting menu wasn‚Äôt my favorite but overall very happy
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,4,2,4,"Waitress did not take my order for 40+ minutes, this is not an exaggeration, I started timing after 20. Drink was consistently empty, had to ask someone else for another. Food was average, price was higher than others in the area. Great mojito had it not been mostly ice. Overall, a very average experience, definitely not as special as what they advertise to be."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,4,2,"My Sunday evening meal at Market was good rather than great - good food, pleasant & professional service but very little atmosphere or ambience - felt a bit corporate & minimalist."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,2,3,"Emplacement id√©al, salle spacieuse, cependant, le rapport quantit√©/qualit√©  prix n‚Äôy est pas. 
222‚Ç¨ pour, deux cocktails un jus, trois plats une entr√©e un dessert et un caf√©. 
Voil√†."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,2,3,3,We were very disappointed. We  vistited the restaurant exao2 years ago and it was wonderful. We came back and the four of us didn‚Äôt enjoy the food. There was maybe one dish of all the many dished we ordered that we liked.the serymust be more accurate.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Cuisine moderne bien ex√©cut√©e, ambiance moderne mais pas bruyante, service efficace. Un peu cher mais sans doute √† cause de l‚Äôadresse"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Outstanding taste, service and quality. Do not miss it!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,1,3,Food was over cooked and over priced
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Lovely meal and excellent service.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,5,5,Very nice interior and very friendly staff. Food was mediocre at best unfortunately

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Delicious food in a lovely restaurant!  Everything from the calamari appetizer to the scallops to the desserts were so well done. Highly recommend!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food and service was great. Coktails even better!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Tres magnifique!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,I love it really
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,1,5,4,Food a bit of a shambles. Ordered seared scallops. Declared as a pasta dish with spaghetti...portion was exceptionally small and pasta was like some super noodle. Not a dish of 35 euro. Server was excellent and super friendly. Pity about the food.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"A superb eating experience. The staff was very attentive and polite. The food came out quickly and was excellent both in flavour and presentation. For such a prime location, you can have a really calm and pleasant meal."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,3,4,cuisine d‚Äôun niveau inacceptable par rapport au prix et standing apparent
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,4,2,4,"Ambience was nice, modern and hip. Service was lackluster, at best. Served two tables that were seated after us with drinks, wine, bread and appetizers all before even taking our wine order. Only after complaining did anyone take our order. Appetizer was average (calamari) but rest of meal was very good. There are better values in Paris over all."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Over the top from the welcome to the bill. Not a missed moment and we will be back before our trip ends.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,3,4,Ristorante adatto a pranzo di lavoro. L‚Äôho trovato molto rumoroso.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,4,"The starter Black plate was amazing. Great service and lovely wine. My main of Turbot was very dry and rather boring . My colleagues also said the duck was very average and the sauce dried to a solid on the plate . 

The Black plate out outstanding though. Lovely ambiance."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We had an outstanding experience. Everything, from the food to the service was something beyond what I‚Äôve managed to live and receive from many previous visits to Paris. The professionalism and hospitality from the staff was wonderful and they were incredibly accommodating in many aspects (as oppose to the rudeness one sometimes can find in other Parisian establishments‚Ä¶). They granted us an unforgettable evening and made our last dinner together in Paris one to remember for the rest of our lives, THANK YOU! :)"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Very nice great food friendly service
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,4,2,2,It was our last night in Paris and wanted to go to a special dinner!  We were so disappointed!!!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Really amazing food, very quick service and an absolutely beautiful restaurant."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great vibe
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Absolutely brilliant experience!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Absolutely brilliant location, service, and menu!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,5,5,"The food was very average. We ordered the sampler plate appetizer and was excited as it was a signature dish. It was ok, nothing to write home about. Ambiance was great, service was excellent. For a Jean George restaurant, I expected better food quality."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,4,5,"Food was great. Service was very slow at the beginning, took a while to get water, order drinks, etc. it got better as the night went on. The food was great"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,5,Tr√®s bon accueil personnel adorable.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Our party of 4 had an excellent experience at Market. The meal excited us with wonderful flavors. All courses were perfect! Floren was a welcoming and engaging server. The entire staff welcomed us and made our meal special. Highly recommended to all!!!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We were celebrating our 5th Anniversary and this restaurant made our night even 100 times more special. The manager Etwer was so so so nice I thought for a moment I was a Prince in a Royal palace. Their other manager Louisa was extremely polite, jolly and genuinely sweet. The food was crazyyyyyyy delicious. I would strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone for their special occasions. They are simply a 10/10."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,4,4,"Birthday dinner - from the food to the service to the ambience and the decor, the restaurant was amazing and perfect for a special occasion."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Awesome food, service and ambiance, we will be back!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We have been to the restaurant three times in the past and we love the service, food and ambience."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,2,4,"Extremadamente lento, la comida no es incre√≠ble ni tiene nada de especial. No volver√≠a."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,2,4,4,"Das Preis-/Leistungsverh√§ltnis stimmt hier in keiner Weise. Buratta - und wir k√∂nnen es als Italienkenner und Liebhaber der italienischen K√ºche beurteilen - eine Katastrophe. Der Artischocken Salat mit Avocado f√ºr 17 Euro eine glatte Unversch√§mtheit. Die Black Plate - eine Vorspeiseplatte f√ºr 2 Personen ( f√ºr 68,- EUR) unterirdisch. Eine Kombination aus Sushi, Samosa, Garnelen und 2 weiteren Rollen - insgesamt 16 Teile / 8 pro Person- geschmacklich ein absoluter Reinfall und preislich nichts anderes als Nepp. 

Die Bedienung macht ihre Sache gut  - nach der Zufriedenheit der G√§ste zu fragen verbietet sich - so jedenfalls beim Ober der uns bedient hat - wohl der Anstand - angesichts des wahrscheinlichen Bewusstseins dass die G√§ste hier abgezockt werden."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,2,2,Service was slow. Filet of beef could not be cut with a steak knife. Was looking forward to this restaurant based on reviews. Disappointing outcome.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Extremely pleasant evening, nice atmosphere,  very good food and service. Loved the chevice, while the meat main courses are not as exceptional as the starters. Desserts outstanding. The only flaw: quite expensive."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,We are visiting Paris and found this place on open table because it was near our hotel and so glad we did. The food and service were excellent. We enjoyed it so much we had to go back again the next night.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,3,"Our dinners were delicious, service was great!  Our server was extremely attentive and helpful, even stepping outside with us as we left to direct us to the Champs Elysees.  It was a delightful dinner!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We had such a great time at Market. It was our first day in Paris and our first trip since COVID and they could not have been more welcoming. Rami, our server was incredible - such great energy and gave us the best menu suggestions - the meal was amazing! Thank you Market and Rami for making our first night in Paris so enjoyable!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Tres bein!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Excellent service, very good food with a voice of simple dishes or more elaborate ones.    Great come back."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,3,5,4,The service was truly impeccable!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,4,4,"This lunch was organised for a colleague retiring from our firm after 30 years of service.
The table was nicely situated and the food delicious.
Everyone was very happy."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great dining experience‚Ä¶..amazing service.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,3,3,"La service √©tait correcte et sympa.  Les entr√©es, les plats et les desserts √©taient sans exception tr√®s faibles: un tartare de thon inond√© par trop de sauce et √©videmment ne pas fait par couteau; un filet de b≈ìuf trop cuit (m√™me apr√®s une commande de cuisson  ‚Äútr√®s saignante‚Äù); des raviolis secs et insipides; une tarte √† cerises √©videmment fait avec ce que les am√©ricains dit ‚Äúpie filler‚Äù avec une glace de pistache qui a le go√ªt et un couleur ‚Äúindustriel‚Äù.  Mais le pire √©tait une pomme pur√©e digne d‚Äôun d√©jeuner de mon √©cole anglais.  Dommage - le soir faisait beau et la service √©tait correcte et sympa mais la carte manque d‚Äôimagination et le repas / cuisine ne vaut pas la visite.  A √©viter."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Now that Paris is opening up again, this was a pleasant way to enjoy Friday evening.  The maitre de chef was prompt and attentive and the food was very good. Some clever ideas on spacing (using some bushes) to allow acceptable distances between tables.  Thank you!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,4,4,3,"A little on the expensive side, lovely outdoors, very tasty food and extra nice staff. Located in a beautiful area."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,joli cadre et carte sympathique avec de nombreuses options
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I am a regular customer of this restaurant (since 2005) precisely and whenever I go there with a friend, male or female, that discovers the place and the food served with the upmost quaity of service and smile, they key in this magical address in their smartphone. 
Highly recommended for their savvy wine list too."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Best restaurant ever
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great find not too far from the Champs d'Elysee.  They didn't offer the brunch due to the vacation period but we found excellent entree and main course choices.  Service was very good, the waiters were attentive and polite.  Loved our meals and the ambiance.  Will definitely go back to explore the brunch.  Highly recommend."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Nice food and service
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"An exceptional meal with excellent service we felt like VIPs. The cooking is incredible, creative, fresh, full of flavour. It is the one restaurant we will always return to whenever we come to Paris. Complete perfection! Thank you."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Wonderful terrasse
Pizzas in the menu are a great choice for children.
Delicious Asian starters"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Our dinner was an event! We arrived a bit early for our reservation and the host had a perfect table picked for us. We started with two perfect cocktails and the tuna tartare. All wonderful. We then shared the mozzarella + basil pizza. So good. We got excellent wine recommendations and ordered our mains. My husband had the sea bream which he said was outstanding. I had the steak. Very good, though it wasn't cooked at medium rare. It came out medium. But it wasn't terrible. I still enjoyed the meat. We ended with desserts and a drink on the patio. Service was stellar all night. Waiters are masked for safety. We would highly recommend. Expensive, but worth it. A perfect spot for our intimate Anniversary dinner."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,4,4,"On y mange toujours tr√®s bien.  Je ne comprends pas que Market ne figure pas au Michelin.
La disparition du menu le rend cher (2 plats, 1 dessert ,2 caf√©s ,1 bouteille de vin, eau en carafe = 150 ‚Ç¨) 
Mais on  reviendra"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,3,3,"Rien d‚Äôextraordinaire au vue du prix, la r√©servation √©tait pour l‚Äôanniversaire de ma fille. Nous avons d√Æner et en fin de repas nous n‚Äôavons pas pris de dessert juste un caf√© (r√©servation pour 5) et l√†, la serveuse nous ram√®ne un dessert sans que l‚Äôon demande avec une bougie üëçsympa je me dis et quand je vois l‚Äôaddition on nous a factur√© le dessert je trouve cela 
limite....üòü"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Bien dans l‚Äôensemble avec un faible pour la black plate
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,3,3,"Once upon a time Market was one of the ‚Äúmusts‚Äù in Paris. 
The shine of this star has faded to a faint twinkle. 
Food below average. Fries soggy. Tables and chairs tired. 
It‚Äôs time to move on!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,2,3,3,Sehr teuer und nur durchschnittliche Qualit√§t. Nicht zu empfehlen.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,5,Good vibe in the 8th. Risotto was outstanding. Great service.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,3,3,Les plats sont bons mais le confort n‚Äôest pas au top... il faisait froid et les banquettes sont √† changer.

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Delicious. All the food was splendid
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,3,4,"I had a nice dinner in Market. The place is well decorated, furnished, with lot of spaces, perfectly located. Buratta to start was good but you can find better one in Paris if you like the best creamy buffala. I enjoyed my tuna tartare with a very good ginger sauce."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Valentines night
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Tout etait super, restaurant parfait je recommande.

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Simply perfect, from arrival to the last 'Have a good evening'. Awesome experience through all senses. Thank you!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Friendly welcome. Attentive staff. Very quick (too quick) service of food. My entr√©e was three samosas on a plate which was too small (in my opinion, with a dip, but no garnish, very tasty though. My filet of turbot was placed on whole glac√© carrots, which I thought could have been better, but well cooked fish and tasty. Good atmosphere with modern lounge music and the tables are well spread out. Overall very good, but just missing the five star rating from me."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,3,5,"Service wasn‚Äôt great, but everyone in the restaurant was very nice. Food was delicious! Would definitely go back in the future."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Nous venons souvent et nous aimons la qualit√© de l'ensemble mais aussi  ce qui correspond au mots  de Charlie Chaplin "" Simplicity is no simple thing"""

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,This restaurant is located in a very secured  affluent neighborhood. The service is top notch. The food is remarkable! I‚Äôd definitely recommend if visiting France. Please make a reservation.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,It was excellent in every single way. Loved it!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great service and food.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great food, superb service"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"A superb meal with excellent service that managed to make you feel that you were always the centre of attention whilst not being over the top and interrupting the conversation with your dining partner. The food was excellent across all courses with very well thought out menu. 

The only downside was that wine choice was a little limited if you only wanted a glass rather than a bottle"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,The truffle pizza was to die for! Our favorite restaurant while in Paris. We went twice in one week. No cold-shoulder attitude here.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"New Years Eve dinner at Market was excellent in every way.  The special menu, the service, the atmosphere.  My only regret is that Market is not close to my home so that we could dine here regularly."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,We had the new year eve set meals.  Everything is great. The passion fruit souffl√© is surprisingly delicious.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Todo muy bien
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,5,4,Not all the Japanese style food was good. Otherwise a decent restaurant.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I ate beef steak, lt was so good! I llke steak's source, it was so delicious!!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,2,2,Overpriced and thoughtless menu. Mediocre service for restaurant in this price range. Style over substance. Avoid if you can.

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,4,Good food. Nice place to eat. Slightly overpriced
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I went to Market twice during my stay in Paris and the service was so amazing. 

Everyone was so lovely and friendly and really went out of their way to make me feel comfortable, especially more so the first time as I was dining alone. That time the waitress was super sweet and made conversation and was super personable, as was the hostess, who remembered me when I came back later in the week with a friend.

The second time I came the service was great, although I would say that the waiter was pushing for a tip and mentioned adding service, which we would have done anyway with prompting, as I noticed the first time service is not included and rounded my bill up, so I would say this ruined it a bit, as it made it feel like the only reason he was nice was to get a tip. But apart from that it was once again lovely and our drinks were topped up without asking and everyone was so smiley and willing to help.

Lovely ambiance and lovely food. Beautiful restaurant."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,We had a beautiful lunch in fantastic surroundings - love the decor and presentation and the lamb chops were amazing
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,3,2,"Le cadre est plut√¥t cosy, l'accueil parisien (professionnel mais pas chaleureux), la carte est fournie, les prix √©lev√©s. Nos voisins et voisines sont bruyants... nous parvenons difficilement √† nous entendre avec mon ami. Nous mangeons vite : moi mon hamburger (pas mal) et lui les St Jacques √† la plancha. Notre nouveau serveur est plus que sympathique, nous papotons, il nous offre le caf√©. Le restaurant a 2 avantages comparatifs : il est plut√¥t bien situ√© et il est ouvert le lundi soir."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Food was great, very nice place and food service"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Couldn‚Äòt recommend it more! Food was more than delicious! 100% worth a visit when staying in paris.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Our family celebrated Thanksgiving at Market and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. The variety of the menu and the food itself was outstanding As we don‚Äôt particularly care for the traditional Thanksgiving meal this was the best dinner ever for our crew. The atmosphere is lovely and the service was impeccable. So hope we will someday return!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great food, service and location"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I took my family for a brunch on a rainy Saturday and the staff has been just amazing, very welcoming and attentive. They let us stay there till quiet late without making us feel uncomfortable. I definitely recommend and look forward to going back to Paris to go here for dinner."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Fabulous food. Great service especially since we were probably the last table sat and last to leave. Delicious!

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Delicios el restaurante un excelente servicio vale la pena muchisisisimo !!!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,4,2,3,"Les plats sont  bons, comme dans mon souvenir, avec une mention sp√©ciale pour les assaisonnements qui sont toujours r√©ussis. 
En revanche, le personnel au service n‚Äôest pas √† la hauteur. Lenteur pour prendre notre commande de boissons, pas un mot de La serveuse qui nous a apport√© nos coupes. Seul un des serveurs a √©t√© √† la hauteur, pr√©sent mais discret et aimable. 
Manque d‚Äôambiance √©galement par rapport au souvenir que j‚Äôavais de ce restaurant."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,4,2,3,"Qualit√© des produits, service moyen, temp√©rature en hiver inacceptable, il faisait tr√®s froid. La temp√©rature est insuffisante et nous avions une table pr√®s de la fen√™tre. Revenir au Printemps et en √©te."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Ein sehr leckeres Essen in sch√∂ner Atmosph√§re. Gute Auswahl an Vor und Hauptspeisen mit sehr guten Desserts.

Wir kommen wieder"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"From the front door we were greeting warmly.  Decor was lovey and the food  prepared by the chef was delicious .

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Me pareci√≥ un ambiente muy agradable y la decoraci√≥n muy moderna y bonita. La ubicaci√≥n buena, cerca de rue st honore.

La  comida me encanto: de entrada una pizza de trufa y de plato fuerte el salmon, ambos platos exquisitos.

Me atendi√≥ un mesero turco muyamable y atento"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Outstanding service and fantastic food!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Good food, quiet, good service."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,3,"Location is excellent and restaurant is very beautiful‚Ä¶ Starters were fantastic and everyone commented on how good they were especially the tuna tartar and the various sampler items‚Ä¶

The only drawback where the mains all were a bit overcooked probably to appease more international/American taste but everyone thought that their dishes should‚Äôve been a bit more on the rare side.  There were also a few comments about things being a bit salty which again is probably to please a more international/American palette‚Ä¶ I would still go to this restaurant again as the overall experience was very nice"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Perfection
Lovely s"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,4,5,Very good as always
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,5,Me and my partner celebrated our anniversary here. We were met with a warm welcome and still able to get a nice table whilst we were running late all the staff ensured we were accounted for especially Theo! And the lady that took our jackets and photos of us after our meal (didn‚Äôt get her name). Overall a wonderful ambience and the food was great salmon cooked to perfection we even got a complimentary cheesecake with a candle lit which really made me and my partner smile thank you for giving us a new memory and a place to visit next time we head to paris. Thank you all
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Absolutely love it. Highly recommend it. Great choice of food; excellent quality and very good service. Not cheap but well worth it

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,It was our last night in Paris.  We were looking for an extraordinary experience.  We found it at Market.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Best burger in Paris!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Service, location were great. We were there for our 10th anniversary. They also acknowledged it by a really delicious dessert. The only thing didn‚Äôt meet the expectation was the French fries. It looked and tasted like it had been bought from a supermarket. Anything else tasted reaaally delicious. Love it."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,2,5,"We are Market regulars. We love their food and service. This most recent visit was clearly an ‚Äòoff day‚Äô. We were largely ignored, never had bread service, shrimp was under cooked, we were overcharged for food."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,2,4,4,Beautiful restaurant but the food missed the mark.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Fabulous meal and service, beautiful decor. Highly recommend."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,The staff was so friendly and courteous. My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary here and our food was absolutely incredible. Great ambiance and worth the visit.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,A faire en couple ou entre coll√®gue. Plats simples et tr√®s savoureux. Le service est impeccable.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"My wife and I very much enjoyed everything about this restaurant that we were referred to in celebration of our wedding anniversary. The ambiance, decor and of course food were exactly what we had hoped for. The service was outstanding and very attentive to our needs including my gluten intolerance. Would most certainly visit them again."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Always excellent! Reliable, comfortable eating solo; good food."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,We had dinner here for our last night in Paris to celebrate our engagement and my fianc√©‚Äôs birthday. The food was amazing! The service was great as well. I asked them last minute to sing happy birthday to my fianc√© with dessert and they did! The quality of food and service for the price was right. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better last night. Thank you!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Loved the modern take on french food at Market.  The ambience is perfect for a nite out and the pricing is reasonable for a restaurant of this quality.  We could not say enough about the service and perfect wine recommendation.  Highly recommend Market if you are visiting Paris.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,5,4,"Great experience overall, wide menu variety in a wonderful part of town."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Celebrated my wife‚Äôs birthday in Paris at Market.  Food and service were top notch.  Each plate was fantastically prepared and the service was great from beginning to end. Would certainly return.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,4,5,"Nice menu, good service. Food was great. Ambience of the place is lovely and it‚Äôs a great location."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Market had a beautiful ambience, service and amazing food. I truly enjoyed my meal and the service and on my next visit to Paris I will be back."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,4,4,Excellent!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,We had a great experience. Classic Jean-Georges. Michelin caliber dining. This restaurant closely resembles Jean-Georges‚Äô Nougatine and ABC Kitchen in New York.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,4,5,"Great Food, friendly service. One course we ordered was forgotten, which shortened pur stay a bit."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Had a lovely dinner and bottle of wine. The sommelier helped us pick out a  delicious bottle of wine and the waitstaff were attentive. The ceviche and tuna tartare were highlights!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,we were on a weekend getaway and this crossed my open table feed. it‚Äôs was great and we were thrilled..def would go back every time i‚Äôm in paris!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,4,"Birthday
Nice surprise by staff 
Really appreciate it 
Great commitment and focus"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We live in the 8th and Market is our go-to for special occasions, visiting friends and family or date night. The black plate is always excellent and the service is friendly as well as immaculate."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,This was our favorite restaurant so far in Paris! The tuna appetizer and other items were awesome! See the pictures!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,4,5,Bread was hard and dry. Seemed stale and it was late night. The burger meat  didn‚Äôt have any flavor or salt pepper or anything thankfully the fixings did. The desserts was the best part of the meal. The cheesecake and the poached pear was delicious. The ambiance was nice and service was good.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,4,3,4,"Unfortunately the bathroom  has bad odors and smells bad.
It is necessary clean it plus frequently and check leaks odors."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,2,5,"Food was delicious. Service was very disappointing for a restaurant of this caliber and price point. They attempted to serve our main course before the appetizer we had ordered, they attempted to serve us cocktails that were ordered by another table, and the glass of wine ordered to have with our meal did not arrive until we were finished eating. For an apology, the restaurant did not charge us for the late glass of wine, and offered us a nice bowl of fresh berries at no charge. While the comped wine and fruit were appreciated, better service would have been desired and expected, and would have earned a 5-star raring"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Service was very professional, food was also very good except for the octopus, which was like a ‚Äúrubber‚Äù."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,3,1,4,"Very sad. Pretty place. Food interesting and good. They delivered two dishes to us in error. Ran Out of many items on menu. Service unbelievably slow and inattentive. Maybe a one time thing but lots of items dropped or knocked over, like ice bucket with wine bottle, plates, etc."

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"It was my first French dinner in Paris. The place, food and service were great."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Ambience was friendly and sophisticated
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,5,5,"The deserts were amazing, however the black plate for two was average and not worth it at 64 Euros, whilst the nachos with guacamole for 19 Euros definitely left us feeling Lille we have been taken for a ride. The portion was tiny and absolutely no different from Chipotle. I love JG restaurants and in Ny they managed to make even the Cezar salad memorable. It‚Äôs an overpriced restaurant riding on a good name. The service was excellent and we are grateful to the staff!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We loved Market and had a wonderful time! The food was great - we had the peppered steak and the ravioli and both were very good (also, coming from an expensive area of the states, we found the prices to be extremely reasonable). I also wanted to give a special shoutout to our server who was really friendly - I speak decent French, but was translating for my boyfriend, and our server was super patient.  Overall, excellent experience! We would definitely come back."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,5,5,"You want to try something different, this is the place for you! No matter what is ordered, it will be light.  French fusion is the best description.   Definitely was worth the experience but a bit overpriced"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wonderful meal.  Furst came here 12 years ago on a prior trip.  Didn‚Äôt disappoint.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Family Vacation
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"There are some fabulous standout dishes, as noted by our waiter (Idris, who was a pleasure and spot on with his wine selections). We ordered them and he was right. 
1) dorado sashimi appetizer
2) salad with shrimp in a champagne hollandaise type sauce
3) sea bream in a wonderful broth of cherry tomatoes and root vegetables
4) parmesan crusted chicken breast in a lemony creamy sauce
5) for the cherry on top, the passion fruit sorbet is so amazing and unique. It was cooked to perfection. The accompanying homemade passion fruit sorbet  also perfect, not too sweet, very intense flavor."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Came in late one night on our final day in Paris and had a lovely meal ; most certainly not the traditional French fare, an Asian riff through everything.  The asparagus with shredded egg and the shrimp salad were fantastic dishes, the tuna spring roll very nice if somewhat derivative.  Service for midnight was exemplary, our wonderful waiter was courteous and informative and definitely helped us pick the right dishes for our mood.  The highlight however was the passion fruit souffle we had for dessert, it was out of this world.  Recommended!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Wonderful, every aspect."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great place with excellent food, duck breast is amazing."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Wonderful restaurant in Paris!! The food and service were excellent. Beautiful restaurant in a nice area. Only gripe was smokers allowed outside, but c‚Äôest la vie in Paris I suppose! Overall a wonderful meal!!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,1,3,"I hate to be critical of restaurants, but do no go.  They tried, but they did not have the experience or training to execute.  The food and service was very ‚Äúamateurish.‚Äù"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,5,5,"Beautiful spot in a luxurious Paris neighborhood. Service was perfect, food was delicious. Not exceptionally creative and a bit pricey but, overall, a really great experience."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,2,3,2,"We arrived and the restaurant was empty.  Friendly and quick service, but the price was not nearly equal to the product.  I ordered two lamb chops for 36 euro and it was over half unedible fat.  We ordered a crabcake for 24 euro and it was not enough for 1/2 a person.  We were extremely disappointed and are unlikely to use OpenTable again. This was to be our Honeymoon dinner and market ruined it."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,5,5,"Food was expensive and not tasty
Service was very good though"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,5,4,"Lovely meal, one of my favrourite reliable restaurants in Paris."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,1,3,Terrible service.  Everyone in the restaurant was complaining about the service and they do nothing. Food was just ok. Nothing great especially for the price.  Would not recommend
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Merci Alice and Warren! Delicious and great service.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,2,1,A wasted meal in Paris.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Graduation celebration
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Just as I imagined as an American chef in Paris (with his family)
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,3,1,3,"Food was ok, wine was excellent, service was not good at all. Waited over 20 minutes just to get water and the waiting just continued from there. Had to ask three times for more water and never received our coffee. Finally the bill was wrong and took awhile to get it fixed."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent service and food. Equivalent to 5 star steak house in USA.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,2,3,"A forlorn outpost of a wordclass chef.   Menu items out but not informed ahead of time.   Appetizer over cooked and should never have left kitchen.  Waitress was impatient and not sincerely unapologetic.  Manager was kind and attentive and tried to save situation, but embarrassing for an establishment of such a well known chef.  Clearly eye has been taken off the ball.  Needs thorough revisit in quality of cooking and attention to service."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,4,4,"Es war einfach zu heiss, da aufgrund der Hitzewelle die Temparaturen extrem hoch waren in Paris. Die K√ºhkungsanlage im Restaurant aber keine Chance hatte..."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,4,4,"Nous avons voulu tester le brunch , et ce dernier est extr√™mement copieux. Cadre simple mais charmant , et service attentionn√© . Recommande fortement."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,2,3,"Paris was  extremely hot and the AC was not working...
Horrible experience"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,5,"Good, not great.  Too few waiting staff. Decent food but not special (considering it is Paris). Staff are really nice, as is ambience. Shame they couldn‚Äôt get service right when busy."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,3,5,"I put this in the system as a special occasion.
Nobody even mentioned it.
Service was slow when we arrived as no one came near the table for ten minutes. The waiter then lost the order and came back 15 minutes after we ordered to retake the order.
Overall food was good but not very impressed."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Fantastic food, great service and a lovely restaurant. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great dinner."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Wonderful food, service, ambiance, etc.  Just what we were looking for in Paris!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Best meal we‚Äôve had in Paris
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"If I lived in Paris the Market would be my weekly dining experience. Excellent food, service and atmosphere. The location is great as well, next door to Christie‚Äôs."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,4,A favorite when in Paris
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Father day visit
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Good food and beautiful restaurant.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,3,5,"Expensive but very worth it. Waiters (in typical French fashion) were inattentive, though. I tried to signal, on two different occasions, a waiter, as we had not been seen by one 20 minutes after arriving. The man who showed up to our table ended up serving as our waiter even though he was not one. He was extremely kind. He made the experience better, otherwise we would have left because no one seems to care about serving our table besides him."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"My wife and I had dinner at Market on a Saturday night.  It is located in a nice area and the restaurant's decor is quite nice and unique for a Parisian restaurant.  The tables were far enough apart that you didn't feel like you were too crowded together like other restaurants.  The drinks were well prepared and the food was spot on.  When we asked to finish our bottle of wine with dessert outside, they were kind enough to move us without hesitation.  I highly recommend Market and we will be returning the next time we are in Paris!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazingly tasty meal. The turbot was best ever.  Service was impeccable, too.  Nice ambiance. Will make this our standard in Paris. Highly recommend."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,1,1,"We sat there and were not spoken to by anyone for over 45 minutes. People who came in after us were seeved while we still sat there waiting to get our drink orders. 

Terrible experience. We usually love Jean-Georges. He is one of our favorites. 

Very disappointing!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,The food was very high quality.  Service was great but you pay for the quality and service.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,4,2,2,Way to expensive for what you get. Loud. Also the service was slow. Food was ok.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Nous sommes venu pour l‚Äôanniversaire de mon copain, une √©quipe g√©niale et serviable"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,1,4,Food was cold and over cooked. Service took 45m for water
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"High quality food, friendly staff and nice ambiance. Price quality ratio is good."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Very attentive service, friendly staff, multi-lingual and of course creative and tasty dishes that offer unique takes on classic cuisine.  One of the best pieces of beef I've ever had in France.  Excellent wine list to choose from.  Normally would expect to pay significantly more for the location and quality of food and service, so excellent value here."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Muy buena opcion
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great meal tucked away off Champs
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Lovely location, beautiful setting and delicious food. Perfect for a romantic evening in Paris!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wonderful like always
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,4,4,Great food and atmosphere
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,We were in the Champs-Elys√©es area shopping and found this on Open Table. A bit of a walk but a great find! More American than French in that they served good liquor in decent sizes ( something we have not found much of here) and butter immediately with the bread! Lol-comforts of ‚Äúhome‚Äù! The food was unique and delicious. Try the seasonal souffl√©!! We had passion fruit souffl√© with mango ice cream or sorbet. Wow! The waitress says it changes with the season. I told her we‚Äôd be back next season for the next! Not inexpensive but nice. And all of the patrons were dressed nicely too!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Todo excelente, el pato estaba mal cocinado"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,5,4,Told them we were celebrating a big birthday. They surprised us with a wonderful cheese cake. Really good service.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We had an absolutely wonderful dinner. Quality of food excellent, service by Adrien was superb and very friendly. a great experience!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Finally a restaurant in Paris with space between tables.  Hope more restaurants take that into consideration.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, amazing service, cocktails were great. Came here to celebrate a special occasion with my girls and will definitely come back..."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great staff! Very friendly and accommodating. Nice continuation of the Jean George Brand.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We celebrates our wedding anniversary. The personnel was so polite, food was great, service was perfect. They also surprised us with a small cake because of our anniversary which was so kind."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,4,3,"Nonplussed by this restaurant.  The presentation was nice, but the food itself was just so-so.  The carrots in the roasted baby veggies we‚Äôre absolutely without flavor.  The lamb was quit fatty and had minimal flavor.  The duck was also mediocre.  Would not go again and would not recommend.  If it was one dish that was off I‚Äôd try again, but both dishes being poor makes me say it‚Äôs just not worth the money.  Two simple meals and a salad was over $100.  This was not a $100 meal, even by Paris standards."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,One of the very best  restaurants we have ever been in Paris. Well done!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,4,4,"Food was great. Service was good an friendly. Neither of us spoke french, but that was not a problem. Cool and hip location.  Locals and travelers a like were dinning."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"My husband and I dined while visiting Paris from the States. The restaurant was fabulous, accommodated us with English menus and all the staff spoke English as well. The food and service was fabulous. Would definitely recommend."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent! Everything was awesome!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"A bustling restaurant on Ave Matignon in Paris. It‚Äôs been years since this reservation and I STILL think about this meal and this experience with a smile on my face. Excellent restaurant, if you want luxury dining at a relatively reasonable price do not hesitate to choose Market."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The place is so cool and modern. The prices are expensive but worth it. Rajoo the manager, was very kind and friendly! He gave us to deserts complimentary! Also the waiter Agis (dont know if its correct) was super friendly and servicable. Highly recommend this place!!!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excited  restaurant
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The last time we were in Paris was in 2012 and we ate at (and loved) Market on that trip. We were a little nervous when we arrived this time to find the place quite empty, but the food and service and charm were all still as great as we remembered. It may have just been an off night but if it is one of the places that is not seen as ‚Äúhot‚Äù right now, we‚Äôd urge tourists and Parisians alike to take advantage of available reservations!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,3,5,4,"Always a pleasure to be there: good location with parking lot right across the street; smooth reservation, friendly and professional reception; tables set allowing space in a quiet and well designed ambiance. Service is fairly rapid and waiters generaly attentionate. Food perfect for business and friendly lunch/diner."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, cocktails and wine. Staff was very knowledgeable when it came to ordering wine by the bottle. They gave great recommendations for both cocktails and wine. The food was superb. Would come back here to eat next time we‚Äôre in Paris."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,4,A great experience as usual. I have been visiting Market for three years now and it is always great. The staff are very friendly and welcoming and the food is excellent.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,5,Amazing servixe
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great food, and amazing service"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Phenomenal food and very friendly and attentive staff, who were also sweet to our toddler."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The food was so delicious, the service was fabulous and the location is amazing. We can‚Äôt wait to go back."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Lunch: Sat us with an English menu! Fresh, creative, outstanding flavors! Friendly service! Don‚Äôt forget dessert!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Encore un merveilleux moment pass√© au Market !
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,1,2,"TERRIBLE!  Been before and was excited for a repeat visit. How wrong we were to get our hopes up. Food was either cold or over cooked.  But we could not get it replaced because nobody was around to help us. No drinks refreshed, no questions about how the meal was, not even anyone to clear the table when we were done, until we asked. Spoke with the manager to let him know about the issues. He then talked to the server who developed a HUGE attitude. She culminated the evening by telling me she did not like me complaining and ‚Äúyou are nothing to me‚Äù and ‚Äúyou are a liar‚Äù.  Just what you expect when you go out to dinner, never mind at a Jean-George restaurant!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,2,Excellent all around. We went twice in same week while visiting Paris!  Sommelier knows what he is doing.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"While in Paris, we didnt want another rich meal. :) Market was outstanding in every respect..food, service and the food. The food was creative, simple yet perfectly complicated, the atmosphere was modern, yet warm ..and the service was outstanding.
I did not realize it was Jean Georges, now I know why it was perfect. üòò"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,4,4,"we will come back again ‚Ä¶ :‚Äî)

and that means a lot"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Birthday bash was awesome
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,4,4,"This is my 4th visit to Market since moving to Paris in January. It is by far my favorite restaurant in Paris. The service is amazing, the black plate is always perfection and I want to eat their bread every single day. My only complaint is that I ordered the cheesecake with candied quince and cassis ice cream. I received berries and strawberry ice cream instead of candied quince and cassis ice cream."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Thank you Market for another amazing dining experience.  After enjoying Market on Christmas Eve and an impromptu visit to Paris, I wanted to share this restaurant with a friend.  I was surprised when our waiter asked if the previous guest  who is a vegetarian was visiting this time.   Her enthusiasm and graciousness was evident the entire evening, as were others who assisted.  The appetizers were spectacular and we went right to dessert and more champagne.  Thank you for a dinner we will remember and appreciate."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Tolles Restaurant. Pers√∂nliche Atmosph√§re. Kreative Karte. Sympathischer Service.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"A great experience 
Staff couldn‚Äôt be more welcoming and food was delicious. Tuna Tartare was soooooo delicious!!!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Black plate is amazing! This is my 3rd time enjoying the black plate and it never disappoints. Service is perfection. And they even spoke English, which exceeded all expectations"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,4,The food was delicious if a bit pricey incredible dessert!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,5,4,Very pleasant!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The food the service Everything was perfect, thank you very much.."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great environment and terrific food. Would definitely go again!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I cannot say enough about how great the experience was.
Food was amazing and the wine recommendation was spot on. 
Service was great. Attentive without being overbearing. Having the chef come out to meet the table at the end was a nice touch.
I have definitely book marked this as a place to return to when I‚Äôm back in Paris"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,In a brilliant location. Beautiful food and wine. Great atmosphere in restaurant. Waiters were very attentive. If visiting Paris again would definitely go back to this restaurant. Top quality!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,4,5,5,"un service attentionn√© , un choix vaste et √©clectique . tr√®s bien"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Service was incredible and the pizza was amazing. Not stereotypical French :)
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Just delicious!!!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,3,3,"For appetiser, I‚Äôve ordered a tuna tartare, I see the staff hold the dish to me but the sauce is floating around, can see clearly the sauce trace, bread was not served hot. Moreover, for every dishes I ordered, nobody gonna introduce the ingredients of the dishes. For the main course, totally disappointed as the sea bass was overcooked. Well, I dun expected to receive a Michelin star restaurant service, but it is the basic manner for the staff to describe the dishes to customer as I dun think this is a brasserie restaurant. For me, i see the service quality more than the taste of the food, which makes me to decide to revisit a restaurant again. Try to communicate with others even they are just normal customer."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,The steamed shrimp salads starter is transcendent. Don‚Äôt miss it
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, atmosphere and service. One of my favorite restaurants."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"La serveuse √©tait super ! 
La pizza au truffes excellente comme √† son habitude, rien √† dire parfait üëåüèº"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,I have experienced several tastes combined in perfect dish!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,1,4,"The person at the reception was not really welcoming, he even looked disappointed that we had a reservation. We didn‚Äôt receive any wine/drink list with the food menu and had a hard time catching the attention of the staff to ask for one. We then had to ask for the English menu, although we talked with the waiting staff in English. The waiters were attentive and kind though. The food was fair but nothing special, except from the Apple tart, recommended by the waiter, that was amazing!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,I never leave a review. I had to leave one for Market. Absolutely delicious and great service. A must try!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,1,1,First trip to Paris meet my wife and bring her to your restaurant but turn bad service bad food too
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,1,1,2,"Absolutely atrocious experience. Service was a mess, no one knew what they were doing. Not until the Manager himself had to come from doing whatever he was doing (not in the restaurant) and personally handle the covers did it turn out somewhat better. Completely overrated. Not sure if it was because it was New Year‚Äôs Day or not."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,1,5,Nice atmosphere and staff but service was slow and the food was luke warm.  Portions were small.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent experience and food was of the finest quality. Great attentive service too.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,5,5,2,"Our experience at Market was a unique and diverse one.  The food was excellent, truly delicious and prepared perfectly.  The service from our very young waiter (he had only worked there for a few weeks) was quite good. He was pleasant and attentive.  I wouldn't call it a traditional French restaurant in terms of its feel and vibe.  It could have as easily been NYC or LA, but that wasn't a problem.  What was disappointing was the incessant and constant barking of a dog that was tied to a table leg in the bar for the entire time we were dining.  True story, see attached photo."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,5,5,5,Hab√≠a un rat√≥n en el restaurante.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Warm and friendly service, great food and location."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Food was absolutely amazing. We ate the group appetizer which was enough for a meal. Entrees were amazing. A bit pricey, but when in Paris, do as the Parisiennes do!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Friendly staff with wonderful food. Outstanding for healthy minded foodies
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,3,Food was quite good - ingredients were fresh and well chosen but the final plates lacked a level of impressiveness at the price point. Service was good. Music was 80s/90s pop which was a relief from holiday music but didn‚Äôt seem to fit with the room.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,3,4,Our family celebrated Christmas dinner. Average food. Overall disappointing experience. Maybe our expectations were too high. Definitely overpriced for value received.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Christmas Eve was special spending it at Market.  We ordered appetizers, dinner and enjoyed the wine we selected.  Having two teens, one of whom is Vegan could have been difficult, but the menu offered options we all enjoyed."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,2,3,The food was very over priced and the menu was unfocused with Italian and Asian dishes. I had the lamb chops which were very good but the appetizers were horrible. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. It was $250 for four people and we left very unsatisfied.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Cher certes..... pour un midi 120‚Ç¨ a deux, sans vin, et, sans dessert....En revanche tellement bon, service impeccable !!!

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Very polite staff, food was prompt, and the treated us with great service.  Quite and dim lit gives you a great opportunity have conversation with those around you."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"This place can only be described as AMAZING! I went here for my birthday and everyone treated me so well and professionally, they acknowledged it was my birthday and everyone was so kind, the food and cocktails were amazing and I would definitely come here again!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,5,5,"C'√©tait un de nos restos pr√©f√©r√©s ou nous sommes all√©s plusieurs fois jusqu'a quelques ann√©es pass√©es. Maintenant vraiment trop cher pour ce qu'on re√ßoit. Int√©rieur, personnel et ambiance sont vraiment ok."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Lieu agr√©able avec une d√©co qualitative
Les serveurs sont sympathiques et efficaces
les desserts sont excellents en particulier le soufflƒó aux marrons
les plats sont moins surprenants que les desserts"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great dinner
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Had a great time at Market - wait staff amazing. Pizza delicious and Brussel sprouts pesto pasta a great choice for be as a vegetarian. Lots of vegetarian options and they would modify dishes for me. Family loved chicken samosas and tomato soup.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,4,2,4,"2nd visit, another poor experience with wait staff.  Food was good, but slow to arrive at table.
I like this place for its food and ambiance but have lower my expectations regarding service."

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Dined at this restaurant to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and the staff made it very special. Exceptional customer service from the moment we arrived right to the very end. The meal was nothing short of outstanding. Look forward to visiting again when I return to Paris!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,4,4,Restaurant tres agr√©able o√π on mange tres tres bien
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,5,3,4,"Delicious food in a very upmarket location - we had trouble picking dishes as they all sounded so tempting - however the staff really seemed to let this place down. There was a general feeling of disorganization, we waited an age for bread and our drinks order to be taken despite the two tables next to us receiving theirs very early, we had to chase. The wine wasn't terribly cold so they put it on ice for ten minutes but didn't offer us anything else in the meantime. We had to ask twice for the wine. They were a long time taking our order, then quickly brought dishes over to us but they weren't ours, took to another table, wasn't their's etc. etc. there was seemingly no management / ma√Ætre d' in charge and instead a lot of staff that didn't know whether they were coming or going. It is not an inexpensive establishment so guests expect a higher level of service and attention to detail. I would return as the food was great but they should sort their staff out."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,This was the best dinner we had in Paris . We loved it so much we went back on Saturday night . The truffle pizza was amazing . The sushi black plate is one of the best sushi I have ever had . On Saturday we decided to have Beef and lamb chops that were perfect. The service was lovely and the manager came over to see if we were enjoying ourselves . I can‚Äôt wsit to come back .
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great location in lovely neighborhood.
Great service, food delicious, intredting menu."

Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Super spot in Paris for every palette. There is something for everyone here. The staff is top notch.
The cuisine is innovative and super fresh."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,4,5,We had a particularly nice quiet table.  The chicken dish was wonderful.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,3,2,4,As a regular over the years this is usually reliable and the food is neither ‚Äòwow‚Äô nor disappointing. But this visit was marred by well intended but at times very slow service. At this price point this isn‚Äôt acceptable.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,3,4,3,"Fresh food, good products, same items on the menu since 20 years... lack of innovation and over spicy in some plate..."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We were in Paris for just 2 days and came across Market and it was excellent!  What made it special was our server, Agathe!  She was vibrant and extremely personable and provided helpful recommendations!"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,5,5,Went to have a nice meal on holiday. Food was very good and tuna spring roll was exceptional.  Wine was reasonable (forParis). Service was very nice and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Awesome as always, 4th or 5th time of coming to this restaurant and it never disappoints."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,We went here for our last dinner in Paris before leaving the next day. The wait staff was excellent and the food was fantastic! Each of us had different entrees and starters and each was delicious.  No fails found here.  They even sang ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù in English to our friend.  Great place!!  Highly recommend!!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,3,4,"Cuisine originale et bonne. 
Service gentil mais tr√®s long. 
Prix √©lev√©s mais normaux pour centre ville."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,1.0,1,2,1,5,"Horrible waiter.... my boyfriend ordered the tenderloin medium well. It came out bloody/rare, sent it back to be cooked further. Meanwhile my dinner gets cold. His comes back, still rare, sent it back again along with mine to warm up, they started over on both and his is STILL bloody and red. At this point we‚Äôve been there an hour and fifteen minutes. The waiter finally says he though he wanted it medium rare. All the while we‚Äôve said medium well, just a little pink in the middle. Ugh! Totally wrecked his birthday dinner. I just wanted out and asked for the bill. He disappears, we waited 15 minutes and I finally get asked to the manager. Awful experience"
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Another amazing meal at Market. I highly recommend the crispy sushi, truffle pizza & kale salad."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing place 
Very romantic 
Waitress was very nice and accommodating . Dimmed lighting made the place very romantic . Upscale crowd ."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,3,4,Am always happy to eat at any Jean George‚Äôs restaurant anywhere in the world. There is always something on the menu I like.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,3.0,3,4,1,5,"This restaurant has excellent food and ambiance but an unfortunate event sourd the evening (our waiter quit in the middle of the meal) leaving us without dessert or an explanation for some time.  While management‚Äôs gesture ‚Äîa dessert not requested or liked by the birthday girl‚Äî was brought to the table is  was inadequate.  Disappointed by management, not the food."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,Celebrated a 60th birthday and everything was great!  The food was delicious and the staff was very efficient.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,2.0,2,2,1,4,"Decided to finally have a nice dinner in Paris tonight and thought I could not go wrong with this place. 

Unfortunately the food was ok and the service was bad. Considering we spent 155 euro for two people it was disappointing to say the least:

Service (1 Star)
It took about 10 minutes to take our drink order and another 15 to take out dinner order. We had to ask for bread and our table was tiny and since we didn't order wine you would think to take the wine glasses away. 

Food (2 Stars)
Appetizer
Pistachio Guacamole with Corn Chips was ok. The guacamole had a hint of pistachio which made it unique but crazy for 19 euro. 

Calamari had no taste and needed salt. It was crispy but really bland. 

Main course
Rigatoni pesto and pistachio was good and pasta was cooked nice

Beef tenderloin was ordered medium rare but came medium to medium well. Because it took so long I ended up not complaining and finished the dish. The sauce and the brussel sprouts and gravy were great but as I tried to finish the beef it got tougher with every bite. The gravy and brussel sprouts saved some of the dish

For dessert we ordered the lemon almond cake and it was ok. Could not discern the lemon not the almond. 

We asked for the check and again it took another 30 minutes. 

All in all not sure if we were considered second class citizens because we sat in the bar area but for a JG restaurant it was surprising to be treated to such lackluster service. 

The waiter was nice but I blame management. It seems like just poor attention to detail and lack of training."
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,3,5,We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner.  Started out quiet at 7:30 PM but soon every table was full and the techno music was turned up and the lights dimmed.  It ended up being our best meal during our stay in Paris.  Loved that it was right next to the Champs-Elysees.  The food was delicious and my lychee and raspberry bellini was wonderful.  We will definitely visit Market when we return to Paris!
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,4.0,4,4,2,3,Toujours fan du cadre mais h√©l√†s le niveau sonore beaucoup trop √©l√®ve (musique) et un temps d‚Äôattente tr√®s long entre chaque plat ou demande extra.
Restaurant Market By Chef Jean Georges,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Awesome ambiance, great vibe, beautiful food presentation and the clean tastes exquisite!  Thank you for the nice break from Paris traditions - Brasseries and Bistros !"

Pamela Popo,2.0,2,1,2,3,"Food was really not good and very bland. Menu wasn‚Äôt properly explained. Service was a bit slow. If a menu item is raw, please include it on there so folks are aware. The veal was not cooked tastefully and it was a bad cut of meat. Definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place."
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,4,5,5,Our dinner was outstanding!! We want to return soon-
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Ein besonderes Lokal. Hip und Cool und trendi, w√ºrde ich sagen. Tolle Atmosph√§re, nettes Servicepersonal. Sehr freundlich. Alles G√∂nge waren lecker und gut. Gute Weinempfehlung. Ein toller Abemd."

Pamela Popo,1.0,1,1,1,1,We left after 1 hour and 15 minutes after ordering because the meal NEVER ARRIVED. The manager did comp our drinks as expected. They were disorganized and confused the entire evening. I would recommend a McDonalds in Paris first

Pamela Popo,3.0,3,3,4,2,Too expensive for what we eat. Restaurant empty no wonder why‚Ä¶..
Pamela Popo,3.0,3,3,4,2,"Not as advertised,  this is a hole in the wall that tries to be good.  Dont waste an evening in Paris here.   Open table is the only on filling this place and its all Americans.   DONT GO WE WISH WE HADNT"

Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,As I told my server - bring me a sharp razor blade! I'll never have a better meal in my life and I wanted to end it right then and there!!!! No where in America could one find a better prepared and served meal then this gem in the Marias.
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,"AMAZING!!! Ambiance, food, the staff, the owners! It‚Äôs such a find in Paris!"
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,Best restaurant in Paris ‚Ä¶don‚Äôt miss the escargot
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,3,Excellent food. Good service. Good wines. A bit pricey
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,No doubt one of the best meals we had while visiting Paris.  Great service to boot!  Can't wait to visit again.
Pamela Popo,4.0,4,4,4,2,Service and food was good but it was loud and felt cramped.
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,What a lovely restaurant!  The food was delicious and the service wonderful!  The dining room is on the second floor overlooking a quaint street.  We‚Äôll come back the next time we‚Äôre in Paris!
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,Simple sophistication at its climax is Pamela Pomo. Their offerings and hospitality are organically honest whilst still delicious and filling.
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent food, high quality and tasty meal but non pretentious which is great. The cocktails were amazing and the staff really know what they're doing. Overall, great experience and I'd definitely go back :)"

Pamela Popo,4.0,4,5,5,4,Great meal for new year‚Äôs eve!
Pamela Popo,4.0,4,5,4,5,"After a disappointing start, our experience at Pamela Popo was excellent.

My issues were with service the first 20 minutes or so.  The two people who stopped by our table initially seemed disengaged bordering on dismissive.  This stood out after a week of impeccable service at other similar Paris restaurants.  Our primary server the balance of the evening was much better. Also, for a fine dining restaurant, I found having to download the menu to my phone to seriously detract from my fine dining experience.  I think having regular menus available as an option should be bare minimum when in a fine dining establishment. Might make me a Boomer, but its how I feel. :-)

The food was excellent.  Ambiance as well. I would request a table upstairs if you can.  80-90% of the tables are upstairs.  We were in the smaller back room upstairs and that was very nice."
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,Our favorite dinner in Paris
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,"My wife and I had an awesome dining experience for our first evening‚Äôs dinner in Paris. We started with a bottle of Cheval Noir from Bordeaux which was an outstanding wine selection. For our appetizer, we ordered the snails which were exceptional and highly recommended! After a brief debate, we ordered the rib-eye for two for our entree which was absolutely delicious! We finished our meal with the chocolate bomb for dessert which we both enjoyed tremendously! Jeremy was our server who was an amazing treat and quite entertaining. Great ambience, service, and overall dining experience! We definitely recommend paying Pamela Popo a visit which was a hidden culinary gem in this amazing city!"
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The dinner was AMAZING, everyone is really nice and warm. The personal was outstanding and so great, the food was SOOOOOO good and the prices are fair, they make you feel so much like home!!
They were so welcoming and I truly recommend this place, they really know how to treat their client!!
An amazing place, I will definitely come back here, probably one of the best places in PARIS!!"
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,"This restaurant is a must. Had dinner Christmas Eve. The beef cheeks were amazing and the chicken w mushrooms awesome as well.

Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We thoroughly enjoyed our Christmas Eve dinner at Pamela Popo. The food was delicious, fast and served so fresh. The pistachio cr√®me br√ªl√©e was probably the best desert we‚Äôve ever had and we were blown away by the fantastic service from their entire staff."
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Pamela Popo hit every high mark for us; delicious and innovative cuisine, personal service, and hip, funky vibe.

Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I went to Pamela Popo on a whim Thursday night because I was flying out of Paris early Friday morning and finally had some time to myself after a long work trip. 

The place is oozing class and modern Parisian sophistication. From its food to its ambiance, Pamela Popo delivers. I had the snails, eggs with mayonnaise and bared tartare, finishing my meal with the beef cheeks bourginon. Everything was delicious, meticulously crafted to paint a picture of what modern French food is. The best part: entire meal was under 100 euros. This is with a cocktail. 

I highly recommend Pamela Popo. The value is top notch and the food spectacular."
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,My wife and I simply loved everything about Pamela Popo. The food was some of the best we had in Paris and not overly expensive for the quality of the meal and experience. Also they could not have been more friendly and accommodating. We chose to eat outside and when it started to get a little cold and rainy they were more than happy welcome us inside for desert. All done with a smile and laughter for all. When we return next to Paris we will definitely go to Pamela Popo again.
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,An excellent French restaurant in Paris. Worth the trip via train. A short walk from the train station. The Pea ravioli was excellent.  Beef cheek was great.  The best was the fish dish was the best.   Service was attentive.  Had dinner alfresco.

Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,We ordered several of the smaller plates and shared. It was all delicious. The gazpacho was lovely and bright and perfect for a hot day.

Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,On behalf of the Will-Burt company I have to say that our business dinner was fantastic. Great & really excellent food & drinks and great service! Thank you for a great night!
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,We were on our last day in Paris. I had gone through recommended restaurants the previous three days and we wanted an open day to explore and choose something on our own. I looked up some restaurants in the Place Vendome area. I saw a review about this restaurant and there were time openings so I made a reservation. It was a 30+ minute walk from Vendome area but it was well worth the effort. The food was great. I couldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant more. We loved it! Sat outside and enjoyed Paris!!
Pamela Popo,5.0,5,5,5,5,Really delicious food with friendly and fast service. Very quirky restaurant atmosphere too.

3 x vegetarian Mezza and 5 meat mezza.
Meat eaters did not notice much difference from the vegetarian option!
Whilst quality was fine the quantity was only moderate.
No Zero/Low alcohol option for lager/beer which was disappointing.
Wine options were good.

Overall 4star as still room for improvement on products although service was good."

Restaurant Assanabel Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s - Cuisine libanaise,5.0,5,5,5,5,The food was delicious and the service was absolutely amazing! Clara and Zach went above and beyond that they truly care about serving their customers
Restaurant Assanabel Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s - Cuisine libanaise,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The star of the experiences - we ate there twice - was definitely Clara, who was charming, helpful (in perfect English) and enthusiastic, but you'll have to hurry to get her before she completes her chemistry studies at the Sorbonne.  Fortunately, the incredibly high quality of the food will doubtless survive her departure.  The mezes were excellent, with pride of place going to the Fattete Assanabel and the Loubia.  The portions are substantial, so we only got to one of the grillades:   the Fatayel Djaj was memorable.  The Lebanese ice cream was a great experience, with a different but attractive texture. The quality/price ratio was ideal.  The location on Rue Jacob is perfect.  (You have to be fairly careful about this - there are two other restaurants called Assanabel in Paris, and I accidentally booked the wrong one and was chided for my non-appearance)."
Restaurant Assanabel Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s - Cuisine libanaise,5.0,5,5,5,5,The  food was delicious and the staff were very friendly and helpful. A completely wonderful experience.
Restaurant Assanabel Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s - Cuisine libanaise,5.0,5,5,5,5,"There are countless Lebanese restaurants in Paris, possibly more than from any other country. Some are take-out places that focus on street food, some informal cafes. I researched the best Lebanese restaurants and found one close to us in St. Germain, one of the oldest in Paris, called Assanabel, and after a lazy morning, we headed there for lunch. Wow! We ordered six mezzes (small plates), and every one of them was absolutely delicious, with just the right balance of herbs and spices to excite the palate. We orders their house Hummus Assanabel (made with garbanzo beans, sesame oil, lemon, parsley and garlic), Chankliche (a goat cheese salad with herbs, tomato, olive oil), Loubia (haricots verts cooked in a tomato concasse), Moujadara (lentils, onions, rice), Kellage (oven baked pita with halloumi cheese, zaatar, tomato), and Fatayer (spinach beignets with pine nuts and sumac). When we ordered mint tea after our meal, they gifted us a plate of irresistible baklava. This was one the very best meals we enjoyed in Paris."

The food was fresh & delicious and the portions generous. Our server was delightful- I was later to discover that she is Clara, mentioned by many other reviewers. She is a true asset.

Restaurant Assanabel Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s - Cuisine libanaise,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I am here in Paris for the first time celebrating my Milestone birthday!!!!  I was looking on OpenTable and came across this JEWEL!!!  Our service from beginning to end was PHENOMENAL!  I am Palestinian so I‚Äôm very picky about Arabic food!  Everything we had was AMAZING!

What‚Äôs more is our beautiful Lebanese waitress Clara was OUTSTANDING!  She was so sweet, courteous, professional, and suggested items we should order for our party of 3!  We had a variety of amazing mazza and the mixed grill of keffta, chicken and lamb. Sooo delicious!!!  We were engaging in conversation with her and felt like we‚Äôve known her forever and she made us feel we could stay all evening‚Ä¶which we practically did. lol. And before she left for the evening, she came to say goodbye to us and wished us a safe and happy time for our remainder of our stay in Paris.

Also they presented me with a surprise assortment of HB desserts and sang Happy Birthday to me AND gave us a complimentary bottle of delicious cut up fruit.

It didn‚Äôt end there!!  In addition the handsome man who gave us our bill was also AMAZING!  So courteous & friendly!  When I mentioned to him, I loved the Arabic song they were playing, I noticed that the music was turned up louder.  We also asked about hookah places and he provided recommendations!

DON‚ÄôT HESITATE!! Make a RESERVATION and ENJOY the entire experience from the ambiance, to the staff and the excellent food!!!"

Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,My group loved it! The server was very nice and accommodating. Food was fantastic!! The little bears were adorable and the atmosphere was great.
Le Choupinet,3.0,3,3,2,3,"If you have a lot of time and patience this is a restaurant for you, orders take between 50 to 90 minutes to get serve"
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,4,5,Food was incredible for the price and the service was good throughout our dining experience.
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Tutto bellissimo e buonissimo.
Una cena di capodanno perfetta. Il cameriere era super attento e cordiale. Ristorante preferito in tutta la vacanza a Parigi."
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,The food was delicious. My sons had the salmon and it was perfectly prepared. I had the onion soup which was rich and warm and I would highly recommend. My husband had the half chicken. The skin was crispy and the meat was tender and moist. The service was excellent and our server was lovely and very kind.
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great experience at le Choupinet for dinner with family/friends. Staff was very welcoming and professional.  Kid and baby friendly. Delicious food. Highly recommend.
Le Choupinet,1.0,1,1,2,1,Booked as the only available restaurant at the given time slot. Not a good way to choose a restaurant. Seeing a mouse running beneath our table put a dampener on the meal. Staff were aware of a mouse problem in the restaurant.
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excelent food, service and experience.  Marine and the staff were superb!  Must go again"
Le Choupinet,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Food menu reasonable value for money.
Drinks menu did not have either low alcohol or zero alcohol options for beer or lager etc This shortfall in the service offer could be easily addressed by the management on both social and health grounds.
Service attentive."
Le Choupinet,3.0,3,3,3,3,"As we have observed on our vacation this year, most restaurants are under staffed. With saying that our server did a great job. We could she how many tables she had, and did her best to manage them all. With service included, she deserved the extra tip.
Food was good, champagne and beer cold."
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,Arrived shortly after arriving in Paris. The perfect Parisian cafe. Service was fast. Great location on the circle. Near our hotel at Le Jardin Du Luxembourg.
Le Choupinet,1.0,1,1,1,1,"The food was really mediocre, as was the service. A tourist trap."
Le Choupinet,2.0,2,1,1,5,"Food was not very good,the ambience was great and the beverages were nice but otherwise would not recommend for dinner.  The frog legs were the best part of all of our meals, so would recommend those."
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Really friendly people, lovely food and chilled experience"
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We really enjoyed eating here. Great food, easy seating with reservation and beautiful ambience!"
Le Choupinet,3.0,3,4,2,4,"Some of the food was very good (clams, chickens, carpaccio), some was just okay- beef tartare, Caesar salad. Drinks were good. Service was very slow and waitress was incredibly inattentive. We sat for 15 min waiting for water for example. There are other brasseries that are much better."
Le Choupinet,4.0,4,4,5,5,The ambience and staff were fabulous!  Felt very American
Le Choupinet,1.0,1,1,3,4,"Unfortunately, a bad experience.  Someone in our party ordered a salad and there was a large insect on it. When we reported it to the waitress her response was ‚Äúsorry that‚Äôs what happens with a fresh salad‚Äù.  Although the place was okay and were not charged for the salad, it was very disappointing and made us think about the cleanliness of this place.  Would not return and would not recommend it to anyone."
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Loved our experience & our waitress. If you have food allergies they not only have GF friendly options on the menu (the best GF pasta according to my daughter) but they are also knowledgeable about the ingredients and can accommodate you. Also, a menu that is in English & French makes ordering so much easier!"
Le Choupinet,4.0,4,5,4,5,Great food! East menu for Americans! Great Variety!
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The ambiance was amazing, server was nice and  knowing a little French went a long way. They were nice and flexible, the food was such a great value for your buck. They do let dogs in the restaurant though, but it didn‚Äôt bother us per-say. My friend said it was the best lamb chops she ever had!"
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,We have had a great dinner with an excellent attention from the team.
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,4,5,Great meal in Paris. Variety of menu items for people wanting authentic Paris experience or just burgers for the kids.
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"After spending a lovely Sunday afternoon, strolling through the Luxembourg gardens we were greeted at the most perfect little Paris bistro. We were offered a seat inside the restaurant or out on the patio.  We chose inside the restaurant as smoking is allowed at all Paris restaurants. And on the streets.  Just not inside restaurants in buildings.  Service was perfectly relaxed and casual. One thing I learned is that we as Americans expect our check as soon as the dishes are cleared. However, that is not the custom here in Paris. The white staff will allow you to sit and linger as long as you want without bringing you a bill.  For the most part around town the wait staff will leave you alone unless you raise your hand and flag them down. We may consider that rude behavior in the states, but that is the preferred method here on the continent.  
The food is excellent Bistro fair.  My son smashed his cheeseburger in seconds flat.  My wife said the fish burger rivaled anything she has it in Hawaii.  The shoestring fries were hot and crispy.  I had the quarter chicken. It was moist and tender and came with light and fluffy potatoes and a savory sauce.  
Open table lists the dress code as business casual, but the vibe and dress code was way more casual.  
I may not ever make it back to Paris , but if I do I will definitely eat at Le Choupinet again."
Le Choupinet,4.0,4,5,4,4,"Perfect spot to enjoy a quality lunch near the park and close to Latin Quarter!  Sat on the patio, and tight tables and a smoking was only drag."
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,We had a wonderful dinner! Food was excellent and it‚Äôs not often you find frogs legs on the menu. Drinks were great and our server Valentina was excellent and absolutely lovely. We had a great time .
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent food and service. I‚Äôll be dreaming about their Croque Madame forever.
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Fun place that you can goto if you are lonely and need company, they will supply a life size teddy bear to join you.  Dinner should take a couple of hours.  Super busy  between 7:30-9:00pm.  The bone marrow is a must!"
Le Choupinet,4.0,4,5,3,4,"The spot is eclectic, and has a unique charm. They have some high-end items on the menu. I struggled to enjoy my truffle butter, but saying that, I‚Äôm really not sure how they both keep it fresh and soft enough to use and so that did not affect my rating. We found medium rare in Paris to be anything but medium‚Ä¶ And so we started ordering our steaks medium‚Ä¶ And that worked well for us except at this location the steak arrived as well done. It was a good cut of meat and well seasoned and so it wasn‚Äôt the end of the world. The other problem I had is similar to many other places, they are likely understaffed through no fault of their own, and therefore service was abundantly slow. The quality of service was good, it just left us wanting throughout the evening. I would recommend this restaurant and I would go back a second time in hopes that the service and food consistency would go from 4 to 5 stars"
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The only place that asked if i‚Äôd like to tip!
American influence in Paris üòÇ"
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"A cosy plage but also very modern with art everywhere in the restaurant.
I loved the typical French food. Koch cheaper than the French brasserie in the same area but the food was amazing"
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Wir haben einen tollen Tisch bekommen. Das Essen war sehr gut. Glutenfreie Option war super und sicher, kommen gerne wieder. Service Team war sehr aufmerksam und super nett!"
Le Choupinet,3.0,3,4,3,4,"essen mit freunden. das essen war sehr gut, preis/leistung ausgezeichnet. der service war bescheiden, nicht sehr aufmerksam und nicht sehr schnell. aber immer freundlich! leider waren die sanit√§ren anlagen die schlimmsten, die ich in paris erlebt habe."
Le Choupinet,3.0,3,4,3,3,I did not love the giant teddy bear taking up room on our tiny table. The server was good once she got to us but it took a very long time for her to come to our table.
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We had an excellent evening
The food was great. By far the best restaurant we ate at in Paris. The atmosphere was magical and the service was incredible. Thanks to our waitress for her good advice and kindness. We will be back"
Le Choupinet,1.0,1,1,1,1,It was terrible.  Waiting 15 minutes for drinks to be ordered and then Another 30 for them to be brought to table. Had to ask for food menu even though we had reservation for dinner.  Then was never asked what we would like.  Finally asked for the check and was asked if we wanted to add a tip.  Very dissatisfied
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Le Choupinet was amazing and such a great find! Our dinner started with cocktails. The cocktail menu was very diverse which was nice and the ones we chose were excellent. Try the French Touch, it was so light and tasty. The perfect cocktail to start dinner. They have a lot of choices to select from on the menu and everything we had to eat was wonderfully prepared. Also, throughout dinner the service was excellent. The waitress was very speedy and attentive and offered help with the menu if needy. When asked for suggestions for desert she suggested an amazing fondant which was to die for. So warm and chocolaty on the inside with vanilla ice cream to go along. The perfect way to end the meal. The ambiance of the restaurant is also very classical French and fun for a night out in the city. We will absolutely return many times to this restaurant, especially given the very reasonable prices."
Le Choupinet,2.0,2,4,1,1,"We brought our 11 month old daughter and the service was horrendous.
They started welding/ sawing metal on a kitchen door which was very loud and caused sparks and caused my daughter to become hysterical and crying because she was scared.
No one came over to explain or tell us what was happening or apologise.
We left after our starters and said they shouldn‚Äôt do that during service and she said oh he was late there‚Äôs nothing we could do. Didn‚Äôt even offer to lower the bill or anything.
Never again."
Le Choupinet,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Bonne nourriture, bcp de choix, service rapide et tr√®s bonne localisation."
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I had a great time at the choupinet, from the food to the service I will come back without hesitation.
Thanks to the team."
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We had an excellent evening. My boyfriend and I had a great time! Our table was very intimate. 10/10 for the atmosphere! The staff was friendly, and everyone spoke very good English. The snails and the tuna tartar were very good, as were the shrimps and the scallops. For dessert, we shared a huge homemade chocolate mousse. Everything was perfect from start to finish. Probably the best restaurant we went to in Paris. See you soon! We will come back on our next vacation :)"
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I was there because I was throwing in the corner and the teddy bears attracted me but what a discovery! It was incredible, good food, excellent service, the staff is very attentive and always smiling I can't wait to go back!"
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,The food was sumptuous and the service was attention to detail and courteous
Le Choupinet,4.0,4,3,5,5,"Although our food was not hot, just above room temp, the taste was amazing. It would‚Äôve been truly superb if it would‚Äôve been hot. So I would definitely recommend this place because the taste was amazing! And they had amazing service. Our server was awesome and kept checking on us regularly. I didn‚Äôt bring up the cold food since it tasted good."
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,Easy to be seated in the window and delish foods. Bone appetite!
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We loved this place! We stumbled up on it as we were walking around for crepes and coffee, not realizing we already had a reservation for the following night. The service was great, the food was great and you must get the escargot! 10/10!"
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Food was delicious, and location was great, definitely recommend!"
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,The Croque Monsieur was to die for. The tuna tartare was delish but a huge portion. The hamburger was one of the best we had anywhere in Paris. Would go back anytime. Loved it!!
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,4,4,This is a great find! Really good food and wine at a reasonable price. Service was great - even during very busy festive period.
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,4,5,4,"We stumbled upon the restaurant and really enjoyed the entire experience! Not only was the food good, but the service was outstanding! This is somewhere you could go on a date, with family or with friends."
Le Choupinet,2.0,2,2,1,2,"Well the waiter was convinced he could remember the order - but he could not.
This even we tried to help him several times. We did not get what we ordered.
The food is not worth talking about"
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wait staff very courteous and attentive. Food was superb. Highly recommend the veal stew.
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,Outstanding food and service. French onion soup was especially tasty and would recommend.
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,Good food and attentive service
Le Choupinet,4.0,4,4,4,5,"As we were in over the change of shifts, service was slow. Otherwise, a very enjoyable spot."
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The food here was delicious. Right next to Shakespeare and co. One of our best meal in Par√≠s. The food, wait staff and location were great. De loved our meal here"
Le Choupinet,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Fun space with great decor, excellent service, and fantastic food. Hope we can return on our next trip! Definitely recommend the chocolate mousse for dessert."
Bloom Sushi Batignolles,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent service dans un cadre agr√©able pas trop bruyant. Les plats v√©g√©tariens sont soign√©s et raffin√©s m√™me pour les mangeurs de viande. Carte des vins trop limit√©e et chauffage insuffisant d‚Äôautant qu‚Äôil n‚Äôy a pas de sas d‚Äôentr√©e.
Bloom Sushi Batignolles,4.0,4,5,5,4,"Service impeccable et carte originale, gouteuse et g√©n√©reuse.
Seul petit b√©mol, il faisait tr√®s froid dans la salle pendant tout le diner (quand on est assis pr√®s des fen√™tres)"
Bloom Sushi Batignolles,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Le travail effectu√© en cuisine doit √™tre impressionnant. Le lieu et l'accueil sont chaleureux. Tout est bon une fois dans l'assiette, les menus sont bien pens√©s. Seuls les desserts sont peut-√™tre un peu en-dessous. Un super moment en tout cas."
Bloom Sushi Batignolles,3.0,3,4,2,2,"L‚Äôaccueil se fait par un geste de la t√™te par le personnel √† l‚Äôautre bout du restaurant. 
La personne proc√®de par demander le nom de la r√©sa, toujours √† l‚Äôautre bout du restaurant. 
J‚Äôai du donc donner mon nom de mani√®re forte pour tout le restaurant. 
Des personnes apr√®s nous auront leur commande prise avant nous. 
Pas de verre et eau, ni commande prise pendant les premi√®res 20 minutes. Le sentiment d‚Äô√™tre oubli√©. 

Ensuite les plats s‚Äôencha√Ænent de mani√®re plut√¥t rapide. L√©ger sentiment d‚Äô√™tre pouss√© √† finir vite. 

Un th√© ou caf√© nous est propos√© en fin de repas. Mais pas de dessert. La table plus loin a des desserts offerts.

Le personnel de cuisine quitte les lieux par la porte d‚Äôentr√©e du restaurant et les derniers d√©tails de travail sont discut√©s √† travers le restaurant, entre le personnel de cuisine et le personnel de salle. 

Nous sommes dans l‚Äôimpression d‚Äô√™tre bouscul√©es pour partir. Or d‚Äôautres tables ont fini leur repas et boissons depuis longtemps et ne sont pas pouss√©es √† partir et finir le repas."
Bloom Sushi Batignolles,5.0,5,5,5,5,Best vegan sushi I‚Äôve ever had! Definitely would recommend

Bloom Sushi Batignolles,3.0,3,4,3,2,"The place looked nice at first, but it was quite dirty. The floor has never seen a mop and my shoes stuck to it. Same with the tables. Although the food was tasty, it tasted like it had been made a while ago, the crunchy parts already gone a bit chewy."
Bloom Sushi Batignolles,5.0,5,5,5,3,"Super restaurant, tr√©s bon. Bon rapport qualit√©-prix. D√©coration super jolie.
Il faisait juste un peu froid dans le restaurant, on sentait des petit courants d‚Äôair."
Bloom Sushi Batignolles,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Petite attention √† la temp√©rature dans le restaurant qui risque assez fra√Æche en hiver le soir. Probablement du √† la proximit√© avec la porte d‚Äôentr√©e et des baies vitr√©es. 

Tout le reste parfait!!!"
Bloom Sushi Batignolles,3.0,3,5,2,4,"Un d√©lice pour les papilles ! 
Dommage que le service ne soit pas (encore?) au point. La proactivit√© et r√©activit√© n'est pas tjs au rendez-vous m√™me si le personnel √©tait agr√©able."

The menu is small, with very interesting dishes (and drinks) we tried different sushis and they were incredible, all of them, my boyfriend was very hesitant when I told him about a vegetarian sushi place but at the end of the dinner he was more thna satisfied.

If you're looking for a quality place, with good prices and that offers a different and interesting concept this is the place"

Hier soir aux Batignolles 
- les serveurs ont oubli√© que je venais pour l‚Äôanniversaire de mon conjoint et n‚Äôont pas mis la bougie comme demand√©e sur son dessert
- on a du demande de la sauce et du gingembre car pas assez dans l‚Äôassiette 
- lxertains sushi √©taient vraiment tr√®s petits et la pr√©sentation dans l‚Äôassiette laisse √† d√©sirer. Pas d‚Äôeffet whaou cette fois comme √† Wagram. Je suis hyper d√©√ßue. √áa ne sera pas une soir√©e dont on se souviendra"

Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We booked a table for 2 on our way home. Neni is situated just across La Gare du Nord and therefore it is the perfect location if you want to grab lunch or dinner before you leave Paris. Service is just perect and friendly. We got a drink from the house as it was my husbands birthday. The chicken i ordered was tasty, my husband was more then happy with his fish plate. Outstanding restaurant with perfect service and quality food. Must-do when you are in Paris!"

Aucune gentillesse ou geste, je mange 20 min apr√®s la table qui est arriv√©e apr√®s et voil√†. Du coup √ßa fait cher pour une exp√©rience mauvaise..."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Charming staff, innovative menu and delicious food - a very pleasant evening. We had the mezze trio, the chicken salad and the chicken shawarma, and cheese cake (to share). We also enjoyed the Lebanese wine, which was a first."

Neni Paris,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Very nice restaurant, just in front of the gate du nord. Cosy ambience and excellent food!
The best service!"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great food and service with excellent background music
Neni Paris,3.0,3,5,1,1,Habitu√© du NENI je l‚Äôai connu lors de l‚Äôouverture et fr√©quent√© pendant plus d‚Äôun an. Nous avons commenc√© au Sape bar o√π mon ami a command√© une coupe de champagne Taittinger brut. Le serveur lui a servi une coupe d‚ÄôIrroy. Je sais que la marque Irroy provient de la maison Taittinger mais vendre un produit autre que celui annonc√© s‚Äôappelle de la tromperie. Ce champagne qui √©tait servi √† volont√© au petit-d√©jeuner n‚Äôest pas mauvais mais ce n‚Äôest pas ce que nous avions command√©. Nous sommes ensuite pass√© √† table au restaurant NENI et ce fut une exp√©rience catastrophique. Serveur pas inform√© sur les rupture en terme de boissons. Nous avons pris 3 menus Balagan mais ne savons pas ce que nous avons mang√© car le serveur n‚Äôa pas pris le temps de nous expliquer ce qui √©tait dans les assiettes de partage. Bien dommage pour un menu d√©gustation. Enfin les deux personnes qui m‚Äôaccompagnaient ont command√© un cognac chacun en fin de repas. Un seul cognac a √©t√© servi‚Ä¶ avec un gla√ßon √† l‚Äôint√©rieur. Nous avons signal√© au serveur qu‚Äôun cognac n‚Äôest jamais servi avec un gla√ßon et lui avons √©galement fait remarqu√© que nous en avions command√© deux. Ce √† quoi le serveur nous r√©pond qu‚Äôil n‚Äôa pas assez de cognac et ¬´¬†qu‚Äôun cognac √ßa sert toujours comme √ßa¬†¬ª en levant les yeux au ciel. Son attitude peu professionnelle ne refl√®te pas du tout l‚Äôambiance que j‚Äôai eu le plaisir de conna√Ætre au NENI. Ne parlons pas du manager pr√©sent ce soir l√† qui a pass√© sa soir√©e sur son t√©l√©phone pr√®s de la caisse sans jamais pointer le bout de son nez en salle. Une exp√©rience bien triste pour NENI et l‚Äôhistoire familiale qu‚Äôil y a derri√®re ainsi que pour le groupe 25 Hours et toute son √©quipe. Tant qu‚Äôil n‚Äôy aura pas de changement en ce qui concerne le service et l‚Äôattitude des serveurs je n‚Äôy mettrai plus les pieds et le recommanderai encore moins √† mon entourage.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Encore mieux que ce qu'on avait pr√©vu. On avait une table ronde bien grande et pas du tout serr√©e contre les autres (donc l'impression de pouvoir bien parler ensemble sans entendre les conversations d'√† c√¥t√© ni de penser qu'on d√©range. Le serveur √©tait plus que comp√©tent et sympa, il √©tait exceptionnel !!! vraiment cool et aimant ce qu'il fait 
La nourriture est vraiment chouette, c'est compatible v√©g√©tariens ou vegans (ouf...) et c'est d√©licieux notamment les houmous vari√©s qu'on a ador√©"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent accueil. D√©licieux shawarma aux pleurotes et copieux qui plus est. . Prix raisonnables.  Je recommande fortement!
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Tr√®s bonne table, ambiance d√©contract√©e, bonne nourriture et personnel √† la fois courtois, agr√©able et tr√®s professionnel. Nous y √©tions pour un brunch dominical, tout √©tait tr√®s bien."
Neni Paris,3.0,3,5,3,3,"The food was very good, the service friendly but we had the impression that we should leave fast after dining.

Would have liked some time to enjoy it. However we were very hungry. Excellent."

Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,3,"Great food, great decoration, very nice service, however not so well installed on high chairs (because of the step on the floor) and price too high (59‚Ç¨ per person for Balagan menu is much to high !!). Very complex location at gare du Nord as well."

Neni Paris,3.0,3,4,1,4,"Service pas bon - le repas pas mal

Le Neni lui-m√™me est un tr√®s beau restaurant. Malheureusement, le service √©tait plut√¥t en dessous de la moyenne et communiquait peu avec nous. Nous avons √©t√© plac√©s √† une table qui se trouve exactement entre les deux entr√©es et sorties. De plus, la table voisine √©tait tr√®s proche de la n√¥tre et c'est pr√©cis√©ment entre ces deux tables que tous les clients et les serveurs passaient. De ce fait, nos chaises √©taient souvent bouscul√©es. C'est tr√®s aga√ßant.
Le service de l'eau et du vin √©tait un peu maladroit et les entr√©es ont mis du temps √† arriver.
Les trois entr√©es √©taient tr√®s d√©licieuses mais plut√¥t en petites portions.
Avant que les plats principaux n'arrivent, nos assiettes sales de l'entr√©e n'ont pas √©t√© d√©barrass√©es. Une serveuse a fait tomber deux fois des couverts √† notre table et n'a pas nettoy√© notre chaise par la suite.
Les plats principaux avaient bon go√ªt mais n'√©taient pas extraordinaires et les portions √©taient √† nouveau petites.
Les serveurs √©taient malheureusement tr√®s silencieux et nous ont √† peine parl√© ou demand√© comment nous avions appr√©ci√© le repas, etc. Ils n'ont donc malheureusement pas cr√©√© l'atmosph√®re de bien-√™tre que l'ambiance promettait. Dans l'ensemble, une visite plut√¥t en dessous de la moyenne. Trop cher pour cela."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Super restaurant, belle ambiance et Mauricio notre serveur vraiment adorable."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"PERFECT, d√©licieux et d√©co magnifique! je recommande vivement ce restaurant"

Neni Paris,1.0,1,1,1,5,"Wir hatten f√ºr den 19.04.2022 (18:30 Uhr) einen Tisch reserviert und trafen um ca. 18:00 Uhr ein. Wir waren erstaunt, dass wir die einzigen G√§ste waren. Nach kurzer Wartezeit wurde uns ein Tisch zugewiesen. Die Bestellung (Getr√§nke/Vorspeisen/Hauptspeisen) wurde z√ºgig, aber mehr als gelangweilt von einer m√§nnlichen Servicekraft aufgenommen. Man f√ºhlte sich nicht wirklich willkommen, sondern wurde als Gast eher so hingenommen.
Die Getr√§nke und zwei der drei bestellten Vorspeisen erhielten wir z√ºgig. Das Brot war jedoch √§lter, da es schon hart war. Nachdem wir den Gro√üteil der zwei Vorspeisen gegessen hatten, erfragten wir ,ob die dritte Vorspeise noch eintr√§fe und bestellten Brot nach. Die dritte Vorspeise erhielten wir dann im Nachgang.
Das nachtr√§glich bestellte Brot war nun auch weich und warm. So wie wir es kennen. Das zeigte nun jedoch eindeutig, dass uns anf√§nglich altes/√§lteres Brot serviert wurde.
Die Hauptspeisen waren in Ordnung. Jedoch fehlte uns der spezielle ‚ÄûNeni Geschmack‚Äú.
An richtig eingesetzten Gew√ºrzen/Kr√§utern/etc. fehlte es vermutlich. Die Entt√§uschung wurde immer gr√∂√üer und wir erhofften uns vom Dessert einen vers√∂hnlichen Ausklang.
Wir bestellten den von uns geliebten Neni Cheesecake, Le Tiramisu d‚ÄôIlan und Sesam sowie 2 Cappuccino. Wir wurden von der nun weiblichen Servicekraft gefragt, ob der Cappuccino zum Dessert serviert werden soll. Dies bejahten wir. Das Dessert traf ein und es war eine riesige Entt√§uschung. Der Cheesecake war geschmacklich unteres Niveau und vermutlich √§lter und matschig. Ich m√∂chte hier nicht √ºbertreiben, aber eine frisch zubereitete Fertigbackmischung h√§tte besser geschmeckt. Das Tiramisu war eine s√º√üe Creme ohne weiteren Geschmack. Der beworbenen Geschmack von Vanille und Madeira war nicht feststellbar. Sesam war undefinierbar. Die bestellten Cappuccinos erhielten wir nicht. Wurden aber in der sp√§teren Rechnung aufgef√ºhrt. Bei der Beschwerde wurde nur der Kopf gesch√ºttelt. Ein charmantes sorry blieb aus. WC ü§¢"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,3,5,Great food and beautiful setting. I really enjoyed the restaurant. A pity the service was quite slow. We were not in a rush so it was fine but I can imagine how this could be annoying.
Neni Paris,3.0,3,4,1,3,"Leider konnte Paris nicht mit unseren durchweg positiven Erlebnissen in Wien nicht mithalten. Die weibliche Servicekraft br√§uchte eine bessere Einstellung zur Arbeit so wie eine Schulung. Die Tische und St√ºhle sind zwar sehr stylisch und alles ‚Äûfranz√∂sisch‚Äú, aber speziell die niedrigen Sitze im linken Bereich waren h√∂chst unbequem. Allerdings konnten wir den Tisch wechseln. Positiv hervorzuheben ist die K√ºche, die einen super Job gemacht hat. Probiert es auch jeden Fall aber selber aus. Die Gerichte ansich rechtfertigen auf jeden Fall einen Besuch."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,5,4,"With 24 hours in Paris on a business trip lay over, my colleague and I took a chance and tried NENI.   So glad we did. The mezze plates were all first rate.   The curry de tofu seemed like an odd choice on an Israeli menu but was full of the fresh vegetables and herbs and the spice was perfectly Mediterranean.
The highlight was our waiter Kevin.  His authentic and effusive opinions on our choices always steered us in the right direction. And his delight when we ordered the knafeh for dessert was so infectious it made it taste even better.  He is a gem."
Neni Paris,2.0,2,2,3,3,"Tr√®s d√©√ßu √† la fois du service et des aliments propos√©s. 

Par contre , grande gentillesse du personnel"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,4,4,"A great evening with extra ordinary food. I can recommend NENI no matter in which city - Paris, Berlin or Vienna."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,Cuisine conviviale. Tous les plats √©taient bons et le service impeccable
Neni Paris,2.0,2,3,1,2,"Accueil m√©diocre, personne ne vous explique comment cela fonctionne. Aucune √©tiquette sur le buffet qui permet de savoir ce qu'on a devant les yeux. Oblig√© de demander deux fois de se faire servir un jus de fruit. Aucun serveur ne passe voir les tables pour  pr√©venir que le buffet va fermer. 
Choix de nourriture bien mais pas assez pour le prix. 
Tr√®s d√©√ßue de la qualit√© de service"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Food, service and ambience were very great. We will come back !"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"From first arriving to leaving, I was really looked after by the Neni team. The food arrived quickly, presented very well and tasted good. Great experience, I will return."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Everything was really good we had amazing experience
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Very good.

We had booked not knowing that there is only brunch on Sundays and upon checking the booking site we noticed that the information is really not highlighted at all. This is the only downside because the rest was really good.

However, as we came with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan ""√† la carte"" lunch, we were a little disappointed.

Anyway, thank you for the pleasant time in your establishment."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,3,4,Beautiful place to share a good times with friends
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,4,5,"The food was delicious. I was throughly impressed by everything. My husband and i ordered a few appies and loved it all. The falafel was honestly the best we have had. And the sauce it came with was so good too! Service was a bit slow and we waited almost an hour for our bill at the end but we weren‚Äôt in a hurry so it‚Äôs okay. Another thing I‚Äôd note is that when we arrived, they brought us two glasses of Prosecco. I assumed this was cuz it was our anniversary which was really nice! We were only in Paris for a couple days but we wanted to come back before we left because the food was so good!! 10/10 recommend"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Zu einem Besuch in Paris geh√∂rt f√ºr mich das Neni dazu.
Trotz schwieriger Buchungssituation waren wir fast die einzigen die dort waren - das erscheint etwas merkw√ºrdig.

Essen war wie immer sehr gut.
Das Ambiente ist sehr geschmackvoll und zur√ºckhaltend.
Insgesamt haben wir das Gef√ºhl, man ist in einem Pariser Restaurant."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The food and service was excellent, our waiter Kevin was amazing, he recommended the Knafeh for dessert which was one of the best desserts I‚Äôve had. Would definitely return"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,La qualit√© de l'ensemble de la prestation √©tait tr√®s originale pour cette belle soir√©e de St-Valentin. Merci √† vous !
Neni Paris,2.0,2,2,1,2,"The service was very slow, we waited for a looong time. The food was ok but I was disappointed as I am familiar with israeli cuisine."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Je recommande ce restaurant, surtout pour les familles. Le cadre est tr√®s agr√©able et spacieux. L'√©quipe est dynamique. Le brunch est tr√®s satisfaisant. Je recommande."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Tout √©tait parfait. Le lieu et la d√©coration sont superbes. La nourriture excellente.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Very good food with adequate pricing for this quality. The whole place is really nice. The service was nice as well. We loved to have lunch there and chill during the following afternoon as a family. Would recommend for sure !
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Really good food and service, music too loud which is really annoying when you stay fir longer than one hour."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Tr√®s bon repas !
Super accueil, la salle est magnifique et tr√®s chaleureuse."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Es war sehr nett und sehr lecker. Ich habe aber ein bisschen zum Beispiel das Hackfleisch vermisst. Was ich so unglaublich lecker finde mit Homos zusammen. Was tats√§chlich einer der Gr√ºnde war, weshalb ich das Restaurant vorgeschlagen hatte."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The food was great and well complimented by very comfortable and arty environment. We have requested to change the table and it was accommodated with a smile. Overall service was really exceptional as our server Mauricio looked after us with a lot of care, efficiency and good mood. Definitely recommend to try, and to book in advance as it got quite busy later in the evening."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Endroit tr√®s sympathique, la nourriture et le vin √©taient tr√®s bons. Mais mention particuli√®re pour notre serveur qui √©tait des plus gentil!!"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,5,5,Nice exp√©rience and delicious food with an oriental touch
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"C'est la 2√®me fois que je d√Æne chez Neni et rien √† dire. En plus d'√™tre tr√®s bien situ√©, le lieu est agr√©able, la d√©co soign√©e et la nourriture excellente."
Neni Paris,3.0,3,5,3,2,Food is good but not so much ambiance and the design of the room
Neni Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Beau potentiel pour ce restaurant : cadre magnifique, menu all√©chant‚Ä¶ malheureusement la promesse n‚Äôest pas tenue et √ßa tourne tr√®s vite √† la CATA.
Vaisselle tr√®s sale, fauteuils et mobilier tach√©s, service √©pouvantable. Certains plats propos√©s sur le buffet dataient clairement de la veille. Nourriture tomb√©e au sol qui n‚Äôa pas √©t√© nettoy√©e de tout le service. Nous avons d√©barrass√© nous m√™me nos couverts.
Nous sommes partis d√©go√ªt√©s et n‚Äôy remettrons plus jamais les pieds."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Food was exceptional, in a great atmosphere.  What a gem near gare du nord."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,4,4,Geburtstag
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,4,5,"The food was excellent. We ordered the ""balagan"" course for two people and had more than enough to eat; in fact, too much. The staff was friendly but had some growing to do for service. Overall a great experience that we will talk about for years to come."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,This place will not disappoint. Get the appetizer trio was unreal  and the wait staff was so kind. Would highly recommend to anyone.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Delicious, beautiful and special ambience."
Neni Paris,1.0,1,2,1,2,"Lieu sympa mais sans plus
Cuisine moyenne
Service lent et non professionnelle
Prix du vin exorbitant
Nous avons demand√© une bouteille de Bourgogne, les prix sont √©crits en minuscules avec d‚Äôautres petits chiffres cr√©ant la confusion en pensant que c‚Äôest une r√©f√©rence mais pas le prix . Nous nous retrouvons avec une bouteille √† 120 euros qui franchement est un d√©lire au vu du lieu ( admissible dans excellent restaurant) mais pas dans un lieu moyen plus proche d‚Äôun joli Mac do que d‚Äôautre chose .
Le serveur n‚Äôa pas du tout pr√©venu.
Bref lieu qui devrait avoir d‚Äôautres pr√©tentions et avoir des bouteilles entre 25 et 30 euros max √©crit lisiblement voir m√™me que du soda !  Mais pas entre 59 et 120 ‚Ä¶ tr√®s loin des standards parisiens peut-√™tre destin√©s √† arnaquer des touristes"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,3,5,"As a vegetarian it can be difficult to find good quality food which is tasty and well-presented in an ambient setting. I have dined in Neni several times and the meal is always delicious. This occasion there was also an improvement in service and wait-time which is good. However, I still feel as a solo older female customer, I don't get the attention which other diners receive. It is not just Neni who react to the single older woman as 'invisible': other restaurants and hotels  are also less attentive. But, perhaps, Neni could take note and improve this aspect of their service?"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,4,5,Endroit id√©al pour passer un chouette moment entre amis
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great place to have a wonderful dinner just next to Gare du Nord. Little paradise in a hectic environment. Food is wonderful and the gar√ßon with the Italian accent is a delight !
Neni Paris,3.0,3,3,3,3,"Eten was van goede kwaliteit. Alleen een fles water kostte 8,50 dat gaat echt nergens meer over.  Dit maakt dat
Ik mij wel een beetje ongemakkelijk voel bij dit restaurant. Overige restaurants die door mij in Parijs zijn bezocht geven gratis tafel water."
Neni Paris,3.0,3,4,2,2,"Le concept de proposer des cr√©neaux pour r√©server √† 14:15 pour une fermeture √† 15h, c‚Äôest illogique. On nous pr√©vient √† l‚Äôarriv√©e. Les employ√©s commencent √† se servir d√®s peu de p√¢tisseries qui restent a 14h45 alors que nous avons pay√© pour un buffet √† volont√© et qu‚Äôils nous ont laiss√© plus rien alors qu‚Äôils sont tous partis avec des bo√Ætes pleines. On a voulu se resservir, il ne restait plus rien. Dommage pour le prix pay√©! Le serveur est arriv√© √† notre table sans dire bonjour et avec l‚Äôaddition sans demander si √ßa nous avait plu ou si on avait besoin de quelque chose, un seul but: nous foutre dehors. Je ne recommanderai pas et je ne reviendrai surtout pas."
Neni Paris,3.0,3,5,3,1,"Excellent culinairement 
Belle deco , mais beaucoup trop lumineux ,  ambiance froide et non chaleureuse. C‚Äôest vraiment dommage , il ne manque pas grand chose.
Ce qui explique peut √™tre le peu de clients pour un vendredi soir ‚Ä¶ce restaurant m√©riterait d √™tre rempli !"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Great menu to discover oriental flavours at a good price point
Very great service and cosy place"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Tr√®s bon brunch avec l‚Äôessentiel. Mes remerciements au staff qui est au petit soin. Je recommande vivement.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,√à un ristorante molto carino e accogliente. Ottima cucina tra libanese e israeliana. Trio di hummus da non perdere.
Neni Paris,2.0,2,4,1,3,"Je ne vais pas laisser de commentaires google car j‚Äôaime beaucoup votre restaurant, cependant, nous avons √©t√© cette fois tr√®s d√©√ßu de la qualit√© du service. Je pense que votre manager n‚Äôy est pas pour rien, et a beaucoup de choses √† apprendre en terme d‚Äôaccueil client, d‚Äôamabilit√© et de gestion d‚Äô√©quipe."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Nice food, Nice peoples In front of the North Station"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,2,4,"Tr√®s bon, copieux. Jolie d√©co.  Service un peu lent et tr√®s bruyant."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,4,Really nice service! I always go there when I am in Paris - right after arriving to Gare Du Nord.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Amazing!! 
Tr√®s beau cadre, bouffe exceptionnelle"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,It was a lovely dinner. The food is outstanding and the service from Am√©lie and Mauricio as exceptional. The place and the decoration is really nice and modern. We will definitely come back!
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,5,4,Great experience and delicious/original food. And our waiter was the best !
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Tout √©tait parfait ! L'accueil,  les produits, avec une mention sp√©ciale pour les sandwichs aux falafels r√©alis√©s en direct et le tiramisu revisit√© qui a lui seul m√©rite que l'on revienne !!!"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Music could be a bit less loud, apart from this, absolutely fabulous!"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Adresse parfaite pour un d√Æner entre amis ou business. Carte originale et de qualit√©.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Restaurant tr√®s bon avec des plats tr√®s go√ªtus, je recommande !"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,4,5,4,"Tout √©tait parfait 
Je recommande les yeux ferm√©s !"
Neni Paris,2.0,2,2,2,3,"Nourriture grasse, le shawarma poulet plein de peau, le reste des plats gras et trop √©pic√©s. 3 sur 4 personnes ont eu une indigestion. Nous n‚Äôavons pas pu continuer notre soir√©e. 
Service amateur : le serveur n‚Äôest pas souriant et nous avons le sentiment de le d√©ranger. Le verre de vin √©tait chaud (venait de sortir du lave vaisselle), du coup verre pas terrible, √ßa a chauff√© le vin. Nous sommes all√© pour le dernier service de 21h, le serveur nous am√®ne l‚Äôaddition pr√©textant une fermeture de cuisine alors que nous √©tions en train de choisir le dessert! Il aurait pu nous pr√©venir que la cuisine allait fermer et que si on voulait autre chose, il fallait se manifester! Un peu d√©√ßue, aucun de nous 4 retournera √† cet endroit."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,So delicious food in a  chill and lovely place! Do not hesitate!!!
Neni Paris,1.0,1,3,1,2,"Service is appalling. We didn‚Äôt actually eat here because despite telling them that we had a train to catch, they continued laying the other tables until we had to leave. There wasn‚Äôt much atmosphere."
Neni Paris,3.0,3,4,2,4,"Les plats √©taient bons et le lieu, d√©co nous ont beaucoup plu. Mais nous avons choisi 2 menus Balagan (genre menu d√©couverte initi√© par le chef), le prix est un trop √©lev√© pour ce que nous avons eu et pour la pr√©sentation, pourtant la carte indique ""pour exp√©rimenter toute la cuisine propos√©e par Neni"".... D√©√ßues d'avoir fait ce choix."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Once again a great meal in a wonderful Atmosph√§reüòä
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,3,5,"Ambiance sympa, belle et bonne assiette. Service un peu jeune qui a fait quelques erreurs (pardonnable !)"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"restaurant agr√©able et design, √† 2 pas de gare du Nord. Parmi les plats test√©s, nous avons particuli√®rement appr√©ci√© le Trio de Mezz√© et le Knaff√© ; √† tester absolument !"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Beautiful location, excellent food, NENI was an experience that was as excellent as I expected it. Great place to be."
Neni Paris,3.0,3,3,1,4,"Revoir le niveau du service 
La serveuse ne savait pas ouvrir la bouteille de vin. 
Service pas pro"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We ordered four dishes to share, sweet potato with spinach, rocket, cr√©me fresh and sesame dressing, sesame eggplant over rice, NENI Chicken Shawarma. Overnight Marinated Chicken,
Roasted Red Onion, Smashed Potato, Garlic Cream, with herb salad and Huile harissa, crumble au levain, persil, huile d‚Äôolive Harissa Oil, Sourdough Crumble, Parsley, Olive Oil.  They were all delightful."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wonderful food and friendly staff! Loved every bit of the evening at Neni.
Neni Paris,3.0,3,5,1,3,"Great restaurant, but the service is horrible! It's a shame, but having to wait forever for your food is really annoying and will keep us from returning to this restaurant."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Je connaissais les adresses berlinoise et viennoise. Ravie d‚Äôavoir une adresse parisienne pour d√©guster les mets Neni. 
Un lieu a√©r√©, lumineux et chaleureux. Un service agr√©able et humain. Tout ce qu‚Äôon aime !"
Neni Paris,1.0,1,3,2,1,"Ambiance impersonnelle, impression d'etre dans un hall de gare"
Neni Paris,3.0,3,4,2,3,C'√©tait un peu cher par rapport au produit propos√©.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Lovely spot, really nice place with nice staff and delicious food."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,4,5,"The food was excellent. The server was incredibly busy, but maintained good cheer, despite running between tables and kitchen. English speakers should bring Google translate."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Cadre tr√®s agr√©able, cuisine d√©licieuse, ambiance cosy.  Un grand merci √† Mauricio, aux petits soins et super souriant :-)

Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Nice place ! Very good food quality ! The meals are tasty
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,3,2,"So tasty, really delicious food. Not much of a vibe but the resto is cute."
Neni Paris,1.0,1,4,1,4,"When we arrived the waiter waived us over to a bar with three stools. We made a table reservation so we politely asked to be seat at one of the many empty tables. Even though we made a reservation for a table and even though there were many empty tables in a nearly empty restaurant he waiter refused. We insisted, why would we be seated at a bar when we made a reservation for a table? Especially so when the restaurant was empty? Eventually the waiter relented and said to my wife that he would seat us at one of the many empty tables. For the rest of the night the waiter was slow, surely and unpleasant and spoke not to me at all and instead only spoke to my wife. The food was terrific but the waiter was the very worst I‚Äôve ever encountered. Fortunately, the waiter was so bad it was actually funny and we were able to enjoy the good food and laugh at the comically bad service."
Neni Paris,1.0,1,2,1,1,"Inside a mall, incredibly slow and uninspiring service. 90 mins and we didn‚Äôt get our dessert so we walked. Didn‚Äôt offer us a second drink. V v poor"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Accueil et cadre au top. Les plats √©taient d√©licieux et copieux. Le service aux petits soins.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Es war ein wundersch√∂ner Abend im Neni Paris! 
Wir waren zum Geburtstag meines Mannes dort und wurden mit einem Glas Champagner aufs Haus begr√º√üt. Der Kellner war sehr zuvorkommend und freundlich. Das Ambiente ist toll, man f√ºhlt sich willkommen und sofort wohl. Das Essen war lecker. 
Wir werden bestimmt wiederkommen!"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wonderful!  Fresh and delicious.
Neni Paris,1.0,1,1,4,4,"I am use to Neni Amsterdam, so my
expectations for Paris we‚Äôre high. Useley the cauliflower nicely charred  and warm and mine was cold and not baked through. 
Thursday i ordered the vegetarian shawarma to go. It was a total disappointment, 21 euro for this dish is as over priced, no salad or pickles were served with it. I had  only chunky mushrooms and pita bread."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Assiettes gourmands et go√ªteux, copieux, service attentionn√© , joli cadre ,prix corrects
Une belle decouverte"
Neni Paris,1.0,1,3,1,1,"Seats are dirty, staff not nice but sarcastic, no pleasant experience.
Too expensive for the food they offer also."
Neni Paris,2.0,2,3,1,3,"We had been to Neni right before the lockdown and had a 5 star experience. This time not such luck. 
I asked for a drink which never came. In the meantime the server was cleaning tables. Why is it when you order an item and it has not come in a reasonable amount of time the server doesn‚Äôt check on it?
The drink finally came and we ordered dinner which did come out in a timely manner. My wife ordered another glass of wine which never came. 
Outside of the falafel, which is 5 stars the food was okay, not special as we had remembered from our first visit."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great meal! Very tasty and relatively convenient location. Can't wait to return!

Neni Paris,3.0,3,3,1,4,overpriced and the staff weren't very helpful or understanding of their own menu
Neni Paris,2.0,2,3,1,1,"Le service n'√©tait pas √† la hauteur. On a attendu 30 minutes que quelqu'un prenne notre commande, entre temps on ne nous √† m√™me pas propos√© d'eau. 
Un lieu tres beau mais aussi d√©sorganis√©... 

Si la nourriture est bonne, le prix est un peu haut, 21‚Ç¨ pour des aubergines et du houmous, c'est un peu haut. √Ä r√©viser de quelques euros. 

Cadre agr√©able mais l'attente + l'ambiance d√©gag√©e par les serveurs qui semblaient compl√©ments perdus n'a pas cr√©√© chez nous l'envie de poursuivre notre repas par un dessert !"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Awesome hidden Gem. We were not sure about the area when we arrived but its a fabulous place~
Neni Paris,3.0,3,4,3,4,Les serveurs ne pr√©cisent pas le prix des extras que l‚Äôon peut demander en plus des plats et ou entr√©es ! C‚Äôest dommage car lors du paiement on est surpris par le prix exorbitant d‚Äôun simple extra.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food was delicious. The ambiance outstanding. We loved to eat here.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,4,5,"really delicious food, love how they have appetizer samplers set up so you can try a bunch of stuff. everything was really good and definitely recommend"

Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,5,4,Delicious food!
Neni Paris,3.0,3,3,2,5,"La qualit√© est meilleure chez Neni a Amsterdam en au Mallorque. Le service n'√©tait pas terrible. Une dame en jeans √©tait bien mais elle pouvait pas g√©rer tout le restaurant toute seule. La fille qui servait notre partie du restau √©tait aimable mais elle avait pas d'exp√©rience en service. On a du demand√© 3 fois une bouteille d'eau avant de la recevoir... J'aime bien le ""Design"" du restaurant."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,4,Nice and relaxingafter other nights in crowded places.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Tr√®s bon accueil, bonne cuisine, √©quipe sympathique ! Nous recommandons vivement :)"

The place is beautiful and the food is perfect."
Neni Paris,3.0,3,5,2,5,"Bei unserem Besuch in Paris dachten wir uns, dass wir ein bekanntes Restaurant aus K√∂ln in Paris besuchen k√∂nnen. Essenstechnisch war alles super. Leider gab es kein Labneh und Oliven f√ºr uns aber f√ºr die anderen Tische schon. Der Kellner war alleine f√ºr den halben Raum verantwortlich und dementsprechend waren die Wartezeiten sehr lang ‚Ä¶ leider etwas entt√§uschend‚Ä¶ hier sollte man etwas mehr in den Service investieren"
Neni Paris,3.0,3,5,3,4,Nice food in good Ambiente. We booked a nice table and get one in the last row :-(

Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,4,4,The food was fantastic. We tried several dishes. I'll definitely come back.
Neni Paris,3.0,3,4,1,3,"Tr√®s bon, mais le service √©tait tr√®s nonchalant, pas attentif, pas √† l‚Äô√©coute. Dommage car j‚Äô√©tais venue il y a 3 ans et j‚Äôavais pass√© un tr√®s bon moment, j‚Äôai √©t√© d√©√ßue."

Neni Paris,2.0,2,2,2,2,Service hyper long ! On a attendu presque 1h30 entre l‚Äôentr√©e et les plats !
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,3,4,"Ich bin mir das erste Mal in einem Neni nicht willkommen vorgekommen. Das hat meinen Geburtstag leider etwas getr√ºbt. Es war eine fast schon kalte Abfertigung. Die Teller wurden einem fast schon beim Essen entrissen. Schade, da zu dieser Zeit recht wenig los gewesen ist, war es wohl nicht dem Stress geschuldet. 
√úber das Essen kann ich nichts negatives sagen, es war wie immer vorz√ºglich."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,5,4,Very god food but if the restaurant is full it is a bit uncomfortable
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"A perfect place when you have just got off the train, or about to get on the train or in Paris! 

Good and wine great, staff excellent."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,4,4,"Food was amazing, service very lovely. 
All tables are quite far from each other which is amazing if you don't want to hear your neighbor's talk and it's very rare in Paris!
Would go back anytime"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great place, great ambiance, delicious food, great service.
Might be a bit too loud if you are a Big group"
Neni Paris,3.0,3,3,5,5,"Ambiance, cadre et service sympathiques
Les entr√©es √† partager sont pas mal, vari√©te et sauce s bonnes
mais les plats (shawarma poulet servi avec la peau, b≈ìuf fa√ßon y√©m√©nite) laissaient un peu √† d√©sirer  (gras et/ou lourd, bien √©pic√© mais pas waow)"

Neni Paris,3.0,3,3,1,4,"J'attends devant un comptoir et des serveurs passent sans saluer...
Notre serveur √† table √©tait tr√®s antipathique et se pr√©sente √† la fin du service devant nous en pr√©sentant la note et en nous regardant sans rien dire. J'√©tais g√™n√© vs mon invit√©e."

Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great experience at Neni Paris.  I‚Äôve been to the Berlin one many times and this location measures up to Berlin.  We had a very charming waiter too.  This is the perfect pre Eurostar lunch/dinner spot since it‚Äôs right across the street from Gare Du Nord.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Our waiter was super kind and attentive. The food was to die for, and I am hoping to return soon! Thank you!"

Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Super experience chez Neni. Cach√© dans un h√¥tel tout pr√®s de la Gare du Nord, on quitte instantan√©ment le raffut de l‚Äôext√©rieur pour un v√©ritable voyage. La d√©coration et les saveurs ambiantes nous transportent instantan√©ment √† des milliers de kilom√®tres. Les entr√©es sont aussi savoureuses que les plats."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"There was group of people shouting all the time  
Restaurant needs to do something with this"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,3,4,"The food is amazing. Try the sharing plates for two for a full experience. The waitress was super friendly and went the extra mile to make you feel welcomed and engaged in conversation! Safe space for the desserts, they are delicious! Sit by the window for a view of Gare Du Nord! Will be back for sure."

Neni Paris,3.0,3,3,2,1,Nourriture bonne mais sans plus. Le soucis de notre repas a √©t√© le service. On se sentait tr√®s seuls. Nous avons attendu beaucoup trop longtemps pour √™tre encaiss√©.
Neni Paris,3.0,3,3,2,5,I‚Äôve been to Neni several times in different countries and try to make a visit anytime I‚Äôm traveling to Europe because of how delicious it is and the ambiance. My last experience was not the best because the server assigned to our table clearly needed some more training (although very kind) and the food was tasty but not as tasty as I remembered it. They could also benefit with some descriptions under the cocktail menu as opposed to asking the waiters and some more drinks on the menu. Overall I love Neni but the menu/service needs some work.
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,4,4,"Excellent, laissez vous guider.. de superbes saveurs"
Neni Paris,1.0,1,2,1,3,"Adresse sans int√©r√™t.

Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,5,5,"√áa fait plusieurs fois que nous allons chez Neni, et nous en sommes toujours ravis !

Neni Paris,1.0,1,1,1,3,"The female waiters was the worst person ever !! 
We arrive to the restaurant and we‚Äôve planned to have the Balagan set menu for 2 and she was like don‚Äôt take it it‚Äôs a lot of food then she keeps pushing to order from the normal menu ... The story not end yet so she came again to rush us to order the main course which it was 9.30 pm as she‚Äôs like oh the kitchen will close ! Do you need anything ... so we‚Äôve order the entrec√¥te steak ‚Äú as we wanted it to be medium well‚Äù we‚Äôve received the meat with full of blood sauce I mean literally they‚Äôve didn‚Äôt grill it ! 

So we decided not to eat as she came again to say the kitchen will close at 10 pm ! Do you need anything or that‚Äôs it .. I‚Äôve explained how bad the meat is it and now I do have a really bad stomach pain :) 

Over all she was so rude & unprofessional at all never saw her before as we do usually come at the lunch time ‚Äú male waitress‚Äù. 
And she lied as we‚Äôve ordered zero sugar coke and then we‚Äôve asked for the normal one ‚ÄúGerman ‚Äú she lied as we don‚Äôt serve it only the zero sugar coke :) so funny and the other table got it !!!!

So better to have good people well behaving than she . 

Big no to this place and never to come back again"

Very pleasant and design place where we can eat fantastic mezze! Each one has a special taste, we loved everything!
Next time we will taste main dishes.

Only flat : cocktails are not the top one for the price. A bit overpriced for the quantity of alcohol for our personal point of view."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent d√©jeuner chez Neni, pleins de saveurs. Personnel agr√©able et ambiance cosy. Une jolie vue s√ªres hauteurs de la Gare du Nord dont on prend le temps d'appr√©cier l'architecture"

Neni Paris,3.0,3,3,4,4,Bon mais prix un peu √©lev√© pour ce type de restaurant. Pas de formule. Plat non conforme √† la description. Les cigares n‚Äôavaient aucun go√ªt
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,Tr√®s chouette adresse inesp√©r√©e en face de gare du nord. Petit tr√©sor cach√©. A recommander aussi aux v√©g√©tariens et vegans.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent moment pass√© chez Neni. Le service √©tait irr√©prochable, la cuisine d√©licieuse avec des assainissements parfaits. Super !"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,The restaurant is amazing. We had a lovely romantic window table with a view to the train station. The atmosphere is very homey. The food is very delicious! Everything we tried was fresh and prepared with a lot of love. The combination of spices was great. Very good selection of wines. The staff was very friendly and professional. They took care of everything! We highly recommend the restaurant and visit it again!
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Always come to Neni when I‚Äôm in town or in any of the cities they have a restaurant in. Their food is absolutely delicious and it has amazing ambiance!
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,3,5,"2√®me passage dans cet √©tablissement.
Bonne qualit√© des plats tout comme la 1ere fois mais le service √©tait un peu moins attentif: il a fallu r√©clamer √† plusieurs reprises eau, pain, carte..."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Je voyage souvent de Bruxelles a Paris, et Neni est mon resto absolument prefere avant d'un voyage Thalys de Gare du Nord. Acceuil chaleureux, service rapide, plats creatifs et DELICIEUX, et joli decor."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Cadre cosy et chaleureux, service avenant et agr√©able, tout √©tait d√©licieux"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Le Neni est sans conteste le restaurant dont la salle m'a fait le plus d'effet, ce depuis de nombreuses ann√©es, alors que je suis me consid√®re comme un foodie qui a vu d√©j√† pas mal d'endroits int√©ressants. 

En fait c'est le genre d'endroit ou bien plus que d'aimer y manger, j'aimerais y vivre : d√©co baroque, entre art d√©co et boh√®me chic, voire boudoir, l'endroit est √©tonnant. L'am√©nagement de cette salle tout en longueur est remarquable.

Que dire de  la cuisine, libano-maroco-isra√©lienne : tous le sproduits sont frais et d'excellente qualit√©, la cuisine est simple, go√ªtue et tr√®s r√©confortante.

Cet endroit donne le sentiment que nous pourrions √™tre partout sur terre, sauf √† Paris. J'y retournerai sans aucun doute."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Perfect evening with great food and fantastic service!
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Delicioud and very cool - super!!!
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"C‚Äô√©tait parfait! Service souriant, ambiance agr√©able, plats d√©licieux,  joli d√©cor. Une oasis de paix dans ce quartier anim√© !"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,3,5,4,"Je recommanderais sans h√©siter d‚Äôaller y boire un verre pour le lieu et la d√©coration / le personnel et l‚Äôambiance vraiment sympa.
Le seul probl√®me c‚Äôest que la nourriture est en dessous (dommage pour un restaurant ) ...
les mezzes √©taient plut√¥t corrects mais les plats largement en dessous de ce qu‚Äôon attendait, idem pour les desserts... 
manque d‚Äôoriginalite et de saveur pour les plats. Assez banal pour le prix finalement : dommage !
Raison ( fondamentale) pour laquelle je ne recommanderais pas d‚Äôy manger"
Neni Paris,2.0,2,1,1,3,"Tr√®s jolie d√©coration du restaurant o√π plut√¥t tr√®s tendance tout d√©pend des go√ªts mais tr√®s agr√©able - par contre la nourriture n‚Äôest vraiment pas au niveau et √† un prix choquant! Mon plat principal  dont je ne me rappele plus le
nom mais quelque chose avec Tel Aviv:  3 minis falafels, du houmous et des aubergines grill√©s avec 2 petits pains pitas pour ¬£25 ! Non c‚Äôest beaucoup trop exag√©r√©e et pas particuli√®rement bon....honn√™tement tr√®s d√©√ßu ! Nous avons aussi command√© une bouteille de vin nous voulions celle du Languedoc la moins ch√®re √† presque ¬£20 mais ne l‚Äôayant pas en stock ils nous ont propos√© un vin libanais √† prix double! C‚Äôest juste un resto pour prendre des photos Instagram...a ne pas refaire ! Passez votre chemin dans le quartier vous trouverez beaucoup mieux !"
Neni Paris,2.0,2,1,2,3,"Tres decevant par rapport a notre ancienne experience a l¬¥ouverture. Plat sans saveur, juste quelques bout de poulet, gros manque de valeur ajoutee. Les serveuses qui ne donnent pas le menu et disent aux gens de se servir dans la pile posee derriere sur une chaise. Le rangemebt des couverts tres bruyant dans mon dos pendant le repas. La caisses collee au dos des clients."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great food, place and service! The zone is not the best, yet the place is beautiful"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Super restaurant et personnel tr√®s √† l‚Äô√©coute serviable et agr√©able. 
Nous avons pass√© un tr√®s bon moment et nous reviendrons avec plaisir."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Loved it! Authentic Israeli Food in comfy atmosphere! 
Try the cheesecake!"
Neni Paris,2.0,2,3,1,4,"Ambiance sympathique et nourriture originale mais gros b√©mol sur le service, attente de 20-30 minutes pour les mezze (falafels et houmous) ou pour une simple bouteille de vin par exemple.
Serveuse totalement d√©sint√©ress√©e qui oublie nos commandes et qui reste tr√®s evasive lorsque l‚Äôon pose des questions sur le menu et le concept du restaurant.
Une grosse d√©ception."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,5,5,"Beautiful place, cool design, nice view, very good food and service. I'll come back for sure in this restaurant!"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Haben auf 19.30 Uhr reserviert und waren die Ersten. Herzlicher Empfang vom charmantem Kellner, un√ºbertrefflich, leider selten so erlebt. Die Wahl des Weines und des Menues wurden gelobt und mit Freude aufgenommen. Wir waren auch vom Platz am Fenster mit Blick auf den Gare du Nord begeistert. Ambiente sehr gem√ºtlich und hochwertig. Dann folgte jeweils eine Etagere mit 3 Vor-, Haupt- und Dessert Tellergerichten. Es sah alles sehr ansprechend aus und hat wunderbar geschmeckt. Teilweise waren es neue Aromen, perfekt abgestimmt und abgeschmeckt. Ab 21 Uhr war das Lokal bis auf den letzten Platz gef√ºllt, Ger√§uschkulisse entsprechend, Kellner hatte sehr viel zu tun und hat sich noch entschuldigt dass er uns dadurch etwas vernachl√§ssigen musste. Wir waren zufrieden, gl√ºcklich und satt, hatten vom Feinsten gegessen. Danke NENI Paris"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Une belle table dans un bel endroit service impeccable et repas d√©licieux
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Un ""havre de M√©diterran√©e""  dans le quartier Gare du Nord. Absolument d√©licieux. Cheesecake NY, un peu hors brief, √©tait succulent ! Pour une soir√©e sympa entre copains."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Nous avons ador√© les saveurs  les accompagnements et les assaisonnements de tous ces plats  originaires d‚ÄôIsra√´l,bravo une belle soir√©e depaysanteb"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Tr√®s bon service et restaurant ‚Ä¶ √† refaire ‚Ä¶
Le tout dans un cadre tr√®s agr√©able et en accord avec l'ensemble de l'hotel."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Fan-tas-tic (the food, the staff, the ambiance) 
Never miss this opportunity if you are in Paris"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,2,4,"Le cadre et le repas ont √©t√© super. Un seul point n√©gatif, un service pas assez pr√©sent"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,4,4,"Tr√®s bon repas, les mets sont d√©licieux. Serveuse agr√©able et cadre sympa. Je recommande."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,This was some of the best middle eastern food I have ever had. The Babaganoush with mint was breath taking. Will eat here again!
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,5,4,Ambiance tr√®s chaleureuse et des plats excellents dans un lieu chic et color√©.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Un super endroit o√π on se r√©gale, on a de la place, hyper bonne id√©e dans ce quartier ! Je reviendrai avec plaisir, entre amis, en famille ou en amoureux il y en a pour tous les go√ªts ! Et h√¢te de tester le bar"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,1,3,"Pour conna√Ætre celui de Berlin qui est exceptionnelle et sans doute l‚Äôun de mes restaurants pr√©f√©r√©s, celui de Paris n‚Äôarrive pas du tout √† sa hauteur. Personnel d√©bord√© qui ne s‚Äôoccupe pas de vous. Il faut syst√©matiquement les appel√©s (si vous √™tes entendus)
Dommage car le lieu est sympa, deco branch√©. La nourriture est tr√®s bonne. Mais quelque chose de commun, comme dans tous les autres tr√®s nombreux restaurants isra√©liens de Paris."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,L'endroit est agr√©able et harmonieux. Joyeux et serein. Le personnel est toujours souriant et sympathique. Et la nourriture est vraiment de tr√®s bonne qualit√©!
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Nice place& very good food! Great service Not too expensive
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Le cadre est aussi beau que la nourriture est bonne. Mention sp√©ciale au serveur absolument adorable. Je reviendrai certainement.
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,5,3,Balagan style was great but the portions were enormous!!
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,3,4,Excellent mais prix un peu √©lev√©s. Je recommande cet endroit.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Tr√®s bon ! Mention sp√©ciale au Sabih revisit√©. 
A refaire"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,5,5,"L‚Äôaccueil et le service sont souriants et efficaces. Ni pression ni attente interminable. Le cadre est tr√®s agr√©able, cosy et intime. Une tr√®s belle d√©co. Le repas est excellent! On a pass√© une tr√®s belle soir√©e. Merci."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,5,5,"tr√®s agr√©able, l'accueil, le service , la d√©co. la nourriture est originale (pour Paris) et bonne."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Soir√©e tr√®s r√©ussie : endroit incroyable, d√©co r√©ussie et nourriture d√©licieuse. Personnel tr√®s agr√©able."
Neni Paris,3.0,3,3,3,4,Trop de Tahini dans chacun des plats. Surement pour tous les fans de Nutella qui le mange √† la petite cuillere. Dommage.
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,1,5,"Wir waren schon in mehreren Neni Restaurants (Wien, M√ºnchen, K√∂ln). Die Speisen waren hervorragend wie immer. Das Ambiente toll. Leider war der Service √ºberraschend schlecht. Vor allem sehr unaufmerksam obwohl das Lokal gerade einmal halb voll war. Das sind wir von Neni Restaurants nicht gewohnt da normalerweise der Service gro√üartig ist."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Resto surprenant par sa deco, sa carte et la qualit√© du service. Une vraie belle exp√©rience √† partager."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,One of the best meals we had in Paris. I highly recommend this restaurant and we will return when in Paris
Neni Paris,3.0,3,3,3,4,Cadre tr√®s joli mais cuisine assez grasse dans l‚Äôensemble.
Neni Paris,3.0,3,2,2,3,"A peine install√© le serveur vient nous demander si on a choisi ce qu'on allait manger. Pratique fort d√©sagr√©able.
Ensuite nous avions command√© une entr√©e √† partager et deux plats. Sans m√™me rien nous demander le serveur nous apporte nos plat alors que nous avions pas fini notre entr√©e. On √©tait venu pass√© une soir√©e tranquille en amoureux on s'est retrouv√© press√© par le serveur.

Ca ne donne pas du tout envie de revenir."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Beautyful restaurant and very kind staff. Loved the NENI food.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Ambiance tr√®s chaleureuse autant par l‚Äôaccueil du personnel que gr√¢ce √† la d√©coration, cuisine savoureuse et joliment pr√©sent√©e. Je recommande vivement ce lieu de partage."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,5,5,"A d√©couvrir imp√©rativement . Lieu comme qualit√© des mati√®res premi√®res et cuisine d‚Äôinspuration Byzantine, libanaise et isra√©lienne L‚Äôimpression aussi du fait de l¬¥implantation en Europe du concept d‚Äô√™tre dans un lieu europ√©en justement.  Un plus serait d‚Äôaccepter le midi les tickets restaurant ."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Une belle d√©couverte ! J'y suis venue gr√¢ce √† ma r√©servation √† l'h√¥tel (le restaurant est install√© au 1er √©tage dans l'h√¥tel) et franchement ce restaurant Neni est aussi r√©ussi que les chambres de l'h√¥tel. Accueil tr√®s chaleureux de la part des serveurs qui prennent le temps de vous parler du concept du lieu, d√©coration urbaine soign√©e avec tables hautes ou basses, cocktails et plats d√©licieux."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Fantastic food and service Fabi and the Restaurant Manager were absolutely outstanding, super attentive and if you like prawns the mains dish was fab"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Cadre magnifique, nourriture excellente, je recommande vivement ce restaurantüíó"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,Une tr√®s bel endroit avec une cuisine originale qui fait voyager.
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,5,"Nourriture excellente, raffin√©e, certains plats un peu sal√©s.
Design magnifique.
Service sympathique.
Enfin un restaurant calme"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Un √©tablissement vivement recommandable cadre particuli√®rement original, un service efficace et aimable, une nourriture succulente et vari√©e. A plusieurs le best of Neni s‚Äôimpose comme le vin blanc du Liban, le rouge √©galement"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,4,4,"Le restaurant est bien cach√©, mais je fus ravie de le trouver car j‚Äôy ai pass√© un moment tr√®s agr√©able. Deco tres sympa, √©quipe sympathique et mets tr√®s savoureux et copieux !! Je reviendrai volontiers :-)"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Un excellent moment et belle d√©couverte 
Tr√®s belle d√©co , plats excellents"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,We loved the atmosphere as well as the cocktail menu. We ordered on the server‚Äôs recommendation and it was all delicious. No room for dessert. I‚Äôll definitely go again when in Paris.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Tr√®s bon restaurant. Tr√®s bon service. Nous y sommes all√©s dans le cadre d'une soir√©e apr√®s une r√©union de travail. Nous n'avons pas √©t√© d√©√ßus.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Le cuisine y est excellente et le cadre.... tr√®s jolie, tout ce qu‚Äôon aime!"
Neni Paris,3.0,3,3,4,3,"Direkt am GARE DU NORD finde ich das Umfeld ‚Äûschwierig‚Äú . 
War mit Kunden im Neni . Es ist schwer zu finden wenn man nicht auf dem Schirm hat dass es im 25 Hours Hotel ist . 
Die Einrichtung ist ganz h√ºbsch , das Essen wird aus meiner Sicht dem Ruf nicht gerecht"
Neni Paris,3.0,3,2,3,4,bon service super d√©cor mais cuisine sans plus ...cher pour le rapport qualit√© prix ...par contre endroit vraiment top ...allez y pour boire un verre !
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"A haven of tranquility close to the hustle and bustle of Gare du Nord - took us a while to find it as we didn't realise it was upstairs inside the 25Hours Hotel.  Tasty food and decent portions - my friend and I shared the hummus trio with flatbread, the roasted cauliflower and a portion of sweet potato fries with delicious mango aioli and found it filled us up. We also enjoyed a delicious bottle of chilled Cotes de Provence Rose wine. Lovely artwork on the walls and a comfortable sofa where we sat after eating to finish our wine. I would suggest getting rid of the rugs on the floor - although nice and colourful they are a hazard and we nearly tripped on them several times (as did the waitress!)"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,The food and dishes were delicious. Unfortuantely no outside seating possible - yet the phenomenal view on Gare du Nord convinces to stay inside and enjoy Paris
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,5,3,"Deco superbe ! 
Service excellent (serveur du Guatemala top) 
Poulet √† peine cuit mais bon quand m√™me"
Neni Paris,3.0,3,2,3,5,"Bel endroit, petite p√©pite aux bords de la Gare du Nord. La carte a chang√© r√©cemment; plats un peu trop lourds et service un peu lent alors que le restaurant n‚Äô√©tait pas tr√®s plein. Petite d√©ception cette fois ci mais le cadre nous fait oublier ."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,3,4,4,"L'ambiance est tres agreable, dans une environnement tr√®s touristique (pres gare du nord), mais Neni c'est une atmosphere tres tranquillement. Le diner c'est bon mais je pense les plats en Neni Amsterdam sont plus mieux.  Tous les plats sont accompagn√© avec humus, pour moi, c'est une petite trop de humus.  Le vin rouge Libanais est magnifique."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,C‚Äô√©tait vraiment d√©licieux ! Et le vin √©tait aussi tr√®s bon. On reviendra !
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great place, food and the waiter was really nice !"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Lieu original, nourriture excellente et service sympathique : un tr√®s bon moment passe √† Neni !"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,5,5,"Super repas chez Neni ! Tout est d√©licieux et le service tr√®s sympa! L‚Äôambiance et la deco sont au rendez vous! Seul petit b√©mol, un peu cher √† notre go√ªt."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Top Qualit√§t und das in Paris zu g√ºnstigen Preisen. Vergleichbar mit dem Speisenangebot des Neni in Berlin, allerdings (bisher) weitaus kurzfristiger buchbar.
Echt super!"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,5,4,Plats exquis et service tr√®s amical.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Tr√®s bien accueillies. Service attentionn√©, tr√®s bons conseils pour le choix des plats et du vin (que nous avons pu go√ªter avant de nous d√©cider). Il a juste oubli√© de nous pr√©venir que ce qui ressemblait √† du poivron dans les brochettes de poulet √©tait un piment, petit coup de chaleur impr√©vu...  Ap√©ritif maison tr√®s original, de couleur rouge, √† base de whisky et de framboise, √† ne pas manquer, m√™me si - comme nous- vous n'aimez pas le whisky! Tous les plats √©taient d√©licieux, nous avons ador√© les Mezze en entr√©e et le dessert ""S√©same"". Ambiance et d√©coration d√©contract√©es. A recommander √† tous ceux qui, comme nous, aiment la cuisine du Moyen-Orient, ou tout simplement, √† ceux qui ont envie d'essayer autre chose."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,D√©cor fabuleux et la cuisine et le vin etaient delicieux! Je recommande vivement et y retournerai surement.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing service and food, the owners really love they restaurant and job! Will certainly return."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,5,5,"Nous avons ador√© le d√©cor , l'ambiance , le service impeccable et sympathique, la vari√©t√© et la saveur des mets. Tout est d√©licieux et parfum√©. Les falafels et les cigares marocains sont √† tomber. 
Petit b√©mol pour l'emplacement , pas tr√®s facile d'acc√®s et stationnement difficile si on a loup√© au passage le parking de la Gare du Nord qui n'est pas donn√©."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Excellents plats, tr√®s belle d√©corations jusque dans les d√©tails. Ambiance remarquable"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"What an all-around fabulous experience! Some of the best Mediterranean food I've ever had, not to mention one of the most unique dining experiences I've enjoyed in Paris. An absolute oasis - absolutely make a trip! Highly recommend the cauliflower, the sabich, and all the mezze. Desserts are unbelievable too, as is the tea selection. The Arak cocktail is worth trying, and you should definitely check out the Lebanese wine."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Prenez le mezz√© ou le dabbing. Le humous est go√ªteux et parfum√©, les aubergines sont savoureuses et tr√®s bien assaisonn√©es. 
 le cheesecake vaut le d√©tour. Tout est bon jusqu‚Äôau caf√©. 
Juste un petit d√©faut qui va bien avec la d√©co, comme √† la cantine, il faut tout manger dans la m√™me assiette."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,3,4,"Bonjour !

Notre serveuse √©tait top, adorable et tr√®s souriante. La cuisine tr√®s bonne. En revanche le personnel n'√©tait vraiment pas sympa. Mon amie en avait pour 16,50 euros, le jeune homme qui l'a encaiss√©e n'avait plus de pi√®ce de 50 centimes et lui a dit ""je ne vous rends que trois heures, je n'ai plus de pi√®ce de 50"" ........ mais qui se permet de faire cela ?? dans ces cas l√†, on trouve une solution, ou on rend 4 euros ‚Ä¶ ce n'est pas une question d'argent mais de principe. J'ai trouv√© √ßa hallucinant. Mais hallucinant. Il √©tait des plus d√©sagr√©ables."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Magnifique endroit pour se retrouver entre amis ou en famille. Super d√©cor. 
Je recommande. 
Le service est tr√®s attentif. 
Je reviendrai."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,2,4,"Dommage que le service ne suive pas, malgr√© la gentillesse de la serveuse, on ne nous a par exemple pas propos√© de prendre un verre quand nous nous sommes assis ou encore nous avons attendu √©norm√©ment de temps la note (que nous avons du solliciter plusieurs fois).
La cuisine est n√©anmoins excellente et la d√©co tr√®s sympa."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,4,3,"Nourriture d‚Äôune qualit√© EXCELLENTE, quel r√©gal !!"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Lieu agr√©able, clair et original. On n‚Äôest pas coll√© les uns aux autres. Les plats √©taient d√©licieux de A √† Z (de vraies olives moyen-orientales, du vrai piment, des falafels succulents, des desserts de r√™ve)."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,L'endroit qui s'av√®re √™tre la p√©pite de Gare du Nord!
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Delicious Israeli food in a lovely atmosphere! 
Would definitely go back and recommend to anyone"
Neni Paris,3.0,3,3,5,4,"Le service est toujours aussi aimable.
Nous avons √©t√© tr√®s d√©√ßus de notre exp√©rience culinaire : le plat ne ressemblait qu'√† une vaste sauce tomate tr√®s piment√©e, alors m√™me qu'elle ne devait pas l'√™tre. Le nombre de poids gourmands et de cubes de polenta √©tait ridiculement faible. Quant au pain, il √©tait immangeable car sec.
Habitu√©e de ce restaurant, je n'ai plus envie d'y retourner."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Petite p√©pite au coeur d'un quartier qui manque cruellement d'alternatives. Id√©al pour une pause avant/apr√®s un d√©part/arriv√©e train mais aussi pour toute occasion, soir√©e entre amis, famille, couple.
Staff excellent, aux petits soins et souriant. D√©cor chaleureux, original et vivifiant! Cuisine sympathique. Belle carte. Restaurant et Bar, deux ambiances diff√©rentes √† tester. Coin sofa du restaurant tr√®s agr√©able. √âtonnamment bien rempli en semaine - penser √† r√©server!"
Neni Paris,2.0,2,2,2,4,"Das Essen war ok, aber nat√ºrlich nichts f√ºr jeden Geschmack. Der Service hat uns nicht so wirklich beachtet, obwohl definitiv nicht viel los war. Schade."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Tolles Ambiente, leckeres Essen. Unbedingt zu empfehlen."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,5,5,"Tr√®s bon accueil, design soign√©, pas press√© par le temps. Mets tr√®s bon, mais je m‚Äôattendais √† une carte un peu plus √©toff√©e."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"G√©nial ! Tr√®s belle soir√©e merci beaucoup. Nous avons mang√© le menu ""d√©gustation"" √† 45 euros par personne et c'tait parfait :)"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Moment charmant et d√©licieux, personnel aux petit oignons, authenticit√©, lieu magnifique, original et hors du bruit, du rush et de la foule. Je reviendrai."
Neni Paris,2.0,2,2,2,1,Food was not good. And not my style place either
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"G√âNIAL !
Super lieu, super service, bon vin et nourriture d√©licieuse. 
Enfin une adresse g√©niale √† Gare du Nord! Je recommande sans h√©siter :)"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Un lieu incroyable, un service exceptionnel et des plats originaux et succulents (++ pour les m√©zz√©s)."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Anniversaire ...
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Superbe d√©couverte ! Le lieu, d√©j√†, totalement improbable dans ce quartier de la Gare du Nord, une d√©co hyper pointue et chaleureuse; l'accueil'ensuite, adorable tout au long du d√Æner ; la cuisine enfin, qui m√™le plats libanais et isra√©liens, savoureux, le dessert-star aussi bon que beau... Bref, Neni a tout bon !"
Neni Paris,3.0,3,3,5,5,"Lieu insolite et magnifique. Les mezze sont tr√®s bons, en revanche, les plats ne sont pas assez raffin√©s"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,3,"Tr√®s bons produits et pr√©sentations dans une vaisselle boh√®me, assez exotico d√©paysant. J'ai trouv√© les prix un peu trop chers. Je recommande le plat de poulpe avec pamplemousse et fenouil j'ai ador√©."
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Resto au top ! Tout fut d√©licieux ! Et service super √©galement
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,5,4,Food was good but I made a bad choice & the whole experience was a bit ‚Äòdeath by hummous‚Äô. We had been warned off the trio of hummous by the waitress.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Tout √©tait parfait, calme pour un d√©jeuner le Dimanche. Service parfait, r√©actif avec gentillesse et discr√©tion. Cuisine originale, g√©n√©reuse. Pain d√©licieux. Carte des vins invitant √† la d√©couverte."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,5,4,4,"Resto sympa, d√©co douce et d√©cal√©e, plat avec le poulpe d√©licieux"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,3,3,5,"Magnifique atmosph√®re et d√©co !

Falafels √† tomber :-)"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,3,4,4,"LE CADRE EST JOLI , hors du commun , tres sympa ..  surtout dans ce quartier !!
mais nous avons ete tres d√©√ßus par les Mezze .. 
la shakshuka avait un arriere gout immangeable , le maquereau etait ordinaire .. 
Nous connaissons bien cette cuisine et nous avons pu faire certaines comparaisons .. 
Nourriture vraiment decevante , dommage car le cadre est hyper sympa !!! 

lors de mon prochain passage tlv , j irai tester et comparer ...  
D√©solee , je ne peux pas recommander l endroit vu la deception !
A noter les serveurs etaient tous sympas , souriants, attentionn√©s .."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,3,"Le son du restaurant l√©g√®rement trop fort. Parfait pour le reste, excellent repas. Du soleil en plein hiver !"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Une tr√®s bonne soir√©e, une cuisine d√©licieuse
Un peu d'attente, pour avoir les menus, pour √™tre servis...compens√©e par un service adorable et des petites choses pour grignoter en attendant !"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,3,5,3,"Tr√®s Bel endroit , tr√®s bonne cuisine et surtout quel service !!!"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Ambiance cosy, assiettes √©quilibr√©es et d√©licieuses, service tr√®s agr√©able en bref, un restaurant √† recommander"
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,4,3,D√©licieux mais tout de m√™me cher. Le th√© √† la menthe √† 7‚Ç¨ !!! C‚Äôest trop !!!
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,5,5,Une cuisine vraiment d√©licieuse dans un cadre √† la d√©coration originale et soign√©e. Le personnel est accueillant et chaleureux.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,4,5,4,"Bien plus cher que NENI Berlin mais on y retrouve ce qui m‚Äôavait plu : un service tr√®s agr√©able, des plats originaux (et assez copieux, attention de ne pas avoir les yeux plus gros que le ventre) et un superbe cadre !"
Neni Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Ambiance d√©contract√©e et Branch√©e. Un havre fun, d√©licieux, inattendu en face de la Gare du Nord. D√©jeuner avec vue tr√®s agr√©able."
Neni Paris,4.0,4,4,5,5,Un lieu qui vous fait voyager comme tous les 25hours.
Neni Paris,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Tres belle decouverte, un service des plus sympathiques et genereux. Un moment convivial et des plats delicieux. Nous reviendrons!"
Neni Paris,3.0,3,3,2,4,"Niveau sonore de la musique trop fort, cadre agr√©able, les descriptions des plats principaux sont trompeuses et ils sont chers pour ce que c'est"
Neni Paris,3.0,3,4,3,3,"Les plats sont excellents quoi qu'un peu cher, on surfe √† Paris sur la mode de la cuisine isra√©lienne et on en paie un peu le prix. On mange en Israel ou dans le bassin m√©diterran√©en les m√™mes plats pour trois fois rien... Le service est un peu √† revoir mais le restaurant est ouvert depuis peu, il n'y avait pas beaucoup de monde. Je me demande comment √ßa se passe quand il est complet. Mais ce qui fait vraiment mal, et l√† c'est aux yeux, c'est la d√©coration, tendance Desigual... Ils ont fait le choix de tables basses avec des fauteuils, ce qui n'est pas pratique pour manger. Il y a des tables hautes avec chaises tabourets, mais la table est un peu large et c'est peu convivial (dommage quand on partage les plats). C'est plut√¥t une bonne exp√©rience culinaire, mais globalement il n'y a pas ce petit truc qui dit ""je vais en faire mon quartier g√©n√©ral""."
DROUANT,3.0,3,3,3,5,"Very beautiful restaurant. Mostly good food except for the steak, which sadly wasn‚Äôt great."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Elegant, comfortable and sophisticated. A great date night place or celebration spot and easy to recommend
Grown ups only"
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"This was our best dinner in Paris with a great atmosphere, wonderful food & drinks, and very friendly and helpful service."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Spent my 40th birthday and everything from the food, service to ambiance was splendid."
DROUANT,2.0,2,2,2,2,"The four of us had placed an order for starters and entrees that was poorly communicated to the kitchen staff. The starters arrived on time. However the entrees took over an hour due to poor communication in the kitchen. When the staff was questioned they blamed it on the rush in the restaurant, although we were among the first in the restaurant to arrive. The voul a vent arrived cold and the seafood was uncooked in the hurry to get it out. The waitstaff never admitted there was a problem other than there were too many people in the restaurant. To compensate, the voul a vent was taken off the bill. However there was no compensation to the other diners who had to wait over an hour for their dishes. I would not recommend this restaurant in spite of its nice surroundings and nicely presented menu"
DROUANT,4.0,4,4,4,4,This was our best meal that we had in Paris. Customer service was excellent.  The quality and presentation of the food was very good.
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great service, excellent food, fantastic wine and great atmosphere save for the very loud Americans sat near us."
DROUANT,2.0,2,2,2,3,"A real disappointment and would not go back. The service was spotty, had to make multiple requests for items, as did other diners. The food was underwhelming and all in all not a place I‚Äôd recommend."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,Everything was top notch! Couldn‚Äôt have asked for anything more
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Beautiful restaurant with very attentive, knowledgeable staff. Excellent service and delicious food."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent restaurant. Food was amazing. Service was impeccable. Would highly recommend.
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"My time there was an utterly and a totally different experience then what I‚Äôve had anywhere in Paris, we truly had a great time"
DROUANT,3.0,3,2,1,3,"The service was pretty awful. They kept changing servers and a new person would be at our table every time we need something. 

The food was cold and the menu choices were limited. 

Not a great experience."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Dinner was great! The food, ambience, and experience were amazing. Our service was not quite right. He wanted us to order very quickly and then later was no where to be find when we wanted additional drinks to enjoy. I would still go back and enjoy another great night."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,Outstanding in every way. Great wine list and help choosing. Beautiful neighborhood restaurant. Fabulous food. Great service. Fairly quiet.
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,4,5,Amazing place to dine. I was a little under dressed for this restaurant. Our waiter forgot about us twice. The first time was 20 minutes. Our second time was after appetizers was 20 minutes. Don‚Äôt know if it was my attire of if he was new. Everything else was superb.
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,For our last meal in Paris I wanted a great French restaurant and did Drouant deliver. The entire experience was amazing.
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,I really loved this restaurant.  The place was beautiful and the chicken and mashed potatoes were fantastic!  Probably my favorite dinner in Paris
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food was fantastic and great service . Strongly recommend it
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,Amazing experience with my family!!!  It was our first night in Paris and they made it so special!
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"This is a lovely restaurant with white table cloths, yet a cozy, inviting atmosphere. ÔøºWe loved our outdoor dining experience.Ôøº They have an enormous, Ôøº reasonably priced wine list. Ôøº We had a smoked salmon appetizer, the grilled veal chop, and the Gatinais chicken. All wereÔøº delicious. Service was friendly and attentive. We highly recommend!"
DROUANT,2.0,2,3,1,2,"Completely disorganized, unprofessional and over rated"
DROUANT,4.0,4,4,5,5,Very quaint upscale restaurant near the Opera. Good menu variety. Would definitely recommend.
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,Absolutely fantastic! One of the best meals we‚Äôve ever had. Can‚Äôt wait to go back again. Incredible.
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,We had very nice dinner in DROUANT. Thank you for kind and warm service and nice foods.  The desert was unbelievable.
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,Outstanding
DROUANT,1.0,1,5,5,1,"They know nothing about the hospitality side of restaurant business. After my meal started they seated a father with very young, very loud child next to me. Refused to move me (even though it is not my fault). I had to pay a fortune for the ""privilege"" of enduring an almost two hour long tantrum. Servers and management completely ignored my pleas to be assisted but everyone else with misbehaving loud children is fine? Seriously considering having my bank card issuer cancel this charge. If the management is reading this I would appreciate your reaching out to me for a refund. I did enjoy the food and the (other aspects of) service but it was egregious to ruin my evening like that. I make it a point to go whenever I am in Paris, but never again. You have lost a loyal customer and advocate."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,What a lovely Easter brunch! Delicious food and gracious service in an elegant yet comfortable dining room. Our younger daughter enjoyed the atelier upstairs where she made a Faberge egg and other creations. Would highly recommend!
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,4,Our food was absolutely delicious and the service was stellar! Even my picky children loved it and wanted to go back!
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,Incredible service with multiple waiters being very attentive. Beef fillet and veal were both very good!
DROUANT,4.0,4,4,5,5,"Polished service, nice environment and good food beautifully presented . Really enjoyed the tartare of langoustine .
It was my brother in law‚Äôs birthday and they surprised him with a candle which was a nice touch"
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Drouant is a restaurant open on Sunday and there are few of those in Paris. We enjoyed our meal and especially the starter vegetable courses, especially the asparagus with grapefruit. Although vol-au-vent is a signature dish I was disappointed, although the pastry was sublime the filling had a weird texture and the veal and prawns tasted the same. The theatre with the steak tartar made our mouths water before it was presented and was very good. I would recommend the restaurant but I would choose more carefully."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Drouant a √©t√© incroyable du d√©but √† la fin. Ma famille et moi sommes arriv√©s √† 10h27 et non seulement la cuisine √©tait sur le point de fermer, mais l'ordinateur du restaurant ne fonctionnait pas non plus. Quoi qu'il en soit, le directeur nous a assis pour une belle soir√©e. Le serveur a expliqu√© le menu et r√©pondu √† plusieurs questions. Il nous a ensuite guid√©s √©tape par √©tape √† travers un tartare de boeuf √† c√¥t√© de la table, ce qui √©tait super. Drouant a l'un des meilleurs filets que j'ai jamais eu avec une sauce exquise et des truffes comme garniture. Encore une fois, merci au personnel de Drouant pour cette merveilleuse nuit."
DROUANT,2.0,2,1,3,2,"Food was subpar, wine was very good."
DROUANT,4.0,4,4,3,3,"Beef was a bit chewy, fish was so so"
DROUANT,4.0,4,5,3,5,Great place in every sense but it is understaffed. We will return because it didn‚Äôt spoil everything but they could do a little better and it would be wonderful üòä
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excelente servicio y calidad e los alimentos !
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Service a bit slow, but food and experience phenomenal"
DROUANT,3.0,3,3,2,2,"I have had a number of set menus before, however, I was rather disappointed at the service received on NYE despite the restaurant not been as busy as expected. We felt very rushed to leave and requested a break after our second course and our main immediately turned up. Steak came out and it wasn‚Äôt cooked as requested. Overall expensive for what it was."
DROUANT,4.0,4,4,4,4,This is not the same as it used to be. Mostly tourists and the menu used to feature French specialties now a thin and pared down version of its former self. While still a pretty place it has lost its French charm. Sad to see.
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Food, service, ambiance were all excellent. The one pairing was also a great touch."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Family birthday celebration while in Paris from San Francisco - also a foodie town.  +1 for Drouant - great menu, outstanding wine list, impeccable service."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The most amazing meal in Paris, must try."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great meal, very attentive and kind staff. A bit on the pricier side but worth it. 5/5 would reccomend"
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,A wonderful restaurant with attentive team and great food and wine
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,A stunning French restaurant which we would highly recommend. Lovely food and really enjoyed our booking here.
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Leek appetizer and vol au vent, both delicious. Delightful experience."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wow. Cannot believe this was not on our list but checked open table and it was highly rated. Five stars is not enough. Do not miss out on the brunch. Best meal in Paris this trip.
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wonderful experience and absolutely delicious food. Special evening.
DROUANT,3.0,3,2,5,5,"Beautiful restaurant with friendly and attentive staff. Food was good, but overpriced for the quality. Magnum of Rose offered was warm on arrival, so they offered ice to put in our glasses - that was a little disappointing. However, the overall experience was good and we would return."
DROUANT,4.0,4,4,5,4,Estuvo bien
DROUANT,4.0,4,4,4,5,I celebrated my birthday that weekend and picked Drouant for brunch. Very nice ambiance. Many courses which I didn‚Äôt expect. It was pricey even with the conversion. We had multiple tend to us but there was a point where we felt abandoned. I did enjoy overall.
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Wonderfukl on all counts
Thank you"
DROUANT,4.0,4,3,5,5,"John 'Dory dish was insignificant in size.   Everyone at our table felt sorry for the person who ordered that.  Fish was insignificant - could have been resolved by providing more food as sides.  The rest of us liked quality and quantity, but when you feel you need to give up some of your food to someone who you think got shorted is not fun for anyone"
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I was a beautiful noght 
With a explendid food , and service"
DROUANT,4.0,4,5,5,5,The meal was Very French and contained the service that makes a French meal great.
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Everything from the moment we walked in to the moment we left, was brilliant.
It was a meal for my partners birthday.
The staff were amazing, and the food was absolutely superb. Wine chosen for us to match are dishes was spot on.
I cannot wait to visit here again on our next trip to Paris.
An amazing weekend, maybe my best.
Thank you to the staff at Drouant."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,The restaurant was very flexible with our group size that changed several times. The service was great and the staff was nice and attentive. The food was excellent!
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Very good service, friendly staff, amazing food! 100% recommend"
DROUANT,3.0,3,3,3,5,"We had a brand new server who did not know that John Dory is a fish. They then served the dish without the sauce and had to be reminded - 15 minutes wait with fish getting cold.

Sommelier and manager tried to make things better by being nice. If it wasn‚Äôt our anniversary, I would have make a fuss !!!"
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,Lovely lunch. Exceptional service and wonderful food.
DROUANT,3.0,3,4,1,3,"One of the most 'booked' places on this site; first time in Paris + wisdom of the crowd: worth a shot.

We were served bread that tasted bad (rye?)‚Äîin Paris, city of bread, bad bread is an anomaly. The appetizers were average for a nice restaurant (smoked salmon with little pancakes) and a 'perfect egg'. My girlfriend for whatever reason was ""not that hungry"" so we shared a fillet at her request. The 'french fries' [I was so looking forward to] were disappointingly similar to American fare. The steak was a decent cut and tasted good, fine value for the price (49 euro) but nothing extra ordinary.

Despite coaxing for her birthday from me, my girlfriend declined a desert prompt from the waiter (the options weren't great anyway), so I asked for the bill, commenting that we had an early morning. Apparently this upset the waiter who then promptly ignored us for over 30 minutes, even avoiding eye contact with me, despite the fact that the restaurant was not full. It was a shame because it changed the mood and our appreciation for our visit to Drouant sharply. It felt intentional and malicious, and almost certainly was. I had to fetch the hostess to get our bill and pay... she was delightful, friendly and prompt and we exchanged some pleasant banter as we paid. She even remarked that she knew it was my girlfriend's birthday (from the reservation) and wished her a happy birthday. IMO, the waiter should be fired and the hostess should get a promotion.

It's not bad by any means, but you can find better."
DROUANT,4.0,4,4,4,4,Food and drink was great. It was my birthday. It was nice but my husband was disappointed they didn‚Äôt stick a candle in my dessert or try to make it special even after he told them it was my birthday.
DROUANT,3.0,3,3,2,4,"Tr√™s joli cadre 
Service en difficult√© ( sous effectif) 
Entr√©es excellentes mais plats d√©cevants 
J esp√®re qu‚Äôil y aura de l‚Äôam√©lioration"
DROUANT,1.0,1,1,1,4,"The place was not crowded. The staff acted like they were the most exclusive restaurant in Paris. (Delusional.) The staff didn‚Äôt deliver the drinks until after the food was served. We wanted the drinks first, of course. They had a lot of staff doing very little. I had better food at mom and pop shops in monte marta-Sacr√©-C≈ìur area. The $49 plate shown in the picture was very good; the fish was simply bad."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great place. Good food and good service. We had a good time.
DROUANT,2.0,2,2,1,2,Chicken was salty and plain. Service was chaotic and nobody seemed to care about getting anything right. Steak was undercooked from how we ordered it and it took forever to get our drinks.
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Crispy Langoustine!!!  Everything else was also tasty.  Very good service but a little unfriendly.  Was good with children who just ordered a main and dessert.

High quality and a nice serious interior making you feel like you are somewhere special.  

Enjoyed it more than the 1m star we ate at later in the week.

Felt a bit of pressure to buy wine but the recommended wine was spot on and delicious"
DROUANT,3.0,3,3,3,3,Average sadly
DROUANT,4.0,4,4,5,5,"Great place, great food, great service and good value for money!"
DROUANT,5.0,5,4,5,5,Wait staff was excellent. Veal dish not so good. Not enough in the dish. It was all chopped into little pieces. Sea bass was good but a very small cut.  Wine selection was very good. The young ladies who took care of us were very friendly and spoke excellent English
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,outstanding
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,I‚Äôve eaten over 100 meals in Paris‚Ä¶Drouant was my favorite. Everything was just perfect. Highly recommend!
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,Amazing is all I can sat
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Outstanding restaurant in the heart of Paris, near the Opera House.  Quaint location with beautiful appointments.  We ordered the Sea Bass and the Filet - both dishes were wonderful.  We will visit this restaurant again when in Paris!"
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,We truly enjoyed the restaurant from the service and friendliness of the food. My wife ordered a spinach salad which was enough for 4 people. I had tasty white asparagus. For dinner my wife had Sea Bass and I had Filet. One of the best meals we had in Paris.
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great experience, I really enjoyed myself as a solo diner."
DROUANT,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Avoid. Not even a restaurant, really. Just a scam for American tourists. Food didn‚Äôt arrive, food was sent back, plates dirty, service was almost entirely non-existent, seemingly only Americans. Astonishing throughout, almost comical.  Worst restaurant experience in memory."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Lovely patio and excellent meal. If you are an avid reader, the history of the upstairs of this place will bring joy!"
DROUANT,2.0,2,2,4,3,"The quality of this restaurant has gone down significantly. When all of the patrons are visitors and not a single local resident, it has become a tourist track based on the history of what it once was. Food was mediocre at best. Extremely disappointed. Service however was ok."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great food, and attentive service. They accommodated my wife‚Äôs food sensitivities, and had great wine recommendations. Cool spot, with a nice patio. Worth checking out."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,We were treated terrifically from when we arrived until we left. Service and the food was impressive to say the least. Wine list was extensive and cover all the bases.  Would recommend as an excellent place for dinner.
DROUANT,3.0,3,3,3,3,The food isn‚Äôt as good as you rate it . It‚Äôs is very average z
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Service was brilliant, as was the setting and food. Would definitely return."
DROUANT,2.0,2,1,4,1,"I know they can‚Äôt control a crying baby but did they really have to sit us right next to the thing in an empty restaurant, also I know French food can be funky this was just gross. Maybe I don‚Äôt get it or I‚Äôm just not sophisticated but this place blows"
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Casa vez que vamos a Par√≠s, cenamos en Drouant, y es as√≠ porque nunca defrauda.  Ofrecen nuevos platos cada vez, muy creativos, el servicio es bastante r√°pido y extra amable. Nos encanta y regresaremos cada vez que estemos en Paris"
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,Good service!
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"El mejor restaurant en d√≥nde comimos en nuestra semana de estancia en Par√≠s. Todo en la mesa era perfecto, gran servicio, bell√≠simo lugar, incre√≠ble sommelier."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Delicious food, excellent ambience, left wanting more!"
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I was a terrible guest, late, on the busiest night ever and did not speak French at a very authentic French restaurant ‚Äî they still went above and beyond to make me feel special and all the attention as expected. Ambiance was romantic with perfect lighting and delightful music. Food was delivered with attention to detail; quality was superb and had authenticity, brought up nostalgia and tender emotions."
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Drouant siempre ofrece una experiencia muy placentera, tanto por la calidad de la comida como del excelente servicio.  Tienen varias √°reas, lo que hace que cada una sea bastante privada y bonita.  Recomiendo este restaurante para cualquier ocasi√≥n.  Adem√°s, queda en un √°rea de Paris muy chic y accesible.  Los encanta!"
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,I highly recommend this place to anyone whose looking for a good dinning experience and delicious food. We were celebrating our honey moon and it was one of the best meals we had in Paris. The pear for desert is absolutely delicious.
DROUANT,4.0,4,3,3,5,"First time in Paris for NYE. Service was good, a bit on slower side, maybe they were short staffed. Staff spoke english and are friendly. Food was okay. My truffle risotto was great, the veal for my husband was ‚Äúveined and chewy‚Äù. Decent wine selection.  
Had a lady singing Adele most of the night, volume was a bit blaring where we sat Upstairs. 
All in all good place"
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great place to your lovely girlfriend
DROUANT,3.0,3,3,4,4,Wine choices were very good. Starters and desserts were excellent. The main (scallops) were served not warm enough. The scallops were quite small.
DROUANT,4.0,4,4,5,4,thoroughly enjoyed our visit. A poor recommendation on the wine and gave us the wrong vintage but otherwise excellent service in a lovely restaurant.
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great restaurant , delicious food and the desserts were sensational . The waiter was impeccable and super exquisite."
DROUANT,4.0,4,5,4,3,"As with many restaurants in Paris, plan to be seated by the kitchen on your first visit (they actually seated us and then made us get up and move to an empty part of the restaurant).  The waiter and his team did their best to make up for the slight.  The food and wine were all excellent.  (The punchline was the table we were asked to vacate was never used while we were there.). Vive la France!"
DROUANT,5.0,5,4,5,5,Ero con una collega e mi sono trovata molto bene: servizio accurato e cibo di qualit√†. Un posto discreto ed elegante.
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,The duck was amazing and had a great time in general
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,Our server Arther was a sweetheart. The food was amazing 10/10
DROUANT,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Really wonderful food and service, beautiful decor. We loved it."
DROUANT,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Honestly I do not understand how an app like OpenTable confirms the reservation, and the restaurant accepts the reservation, WHEN RESTAURANT IS CLOSED.
OUTREAGEOUS"
VERDE BY YEEELS,5.0,5,5,5,5,Amazing night - great food and super fun atmosphere. The DJ was a nice touch for the holidays!
VERDE BY YEEELS,4.0,4,4,3,5,I‚Äôm a frequent traveler around Europe and a foodie so leaving this review in comparison with similar concept restaurants. The food and table service was great - no complaints there. Tuna tartare was excellent and so was my seafood main. My only feedback is that keeping your customers outside the door in the bitter cold queuing up for 10 min when our reservation was at 7 pm was not very courteous and there could have been more effort to apologize for the delay in opening.
VERDE BY YEEELS,1.0,1,3,3,2,"Hemos ido en la noche buena con mis hermanas y este establecimiento no puede ser m√°s decepcionante, si eres turista no te recomiendo porque nos estafaron en nuestra cara. Nuestra consumici√≥n ha sido 250‚Ç¨, y nos agregaron m√°s 150‚Ç¨ de servicio y sus impuestos y para que conste estos montos no estaba  en nuestra factura y le ped√≠ una explicaci√≥n y me empez√≥ a dar un trato desagradable en franc√©s. La comida es buena pero que te traigan la cuenta una cantidad absurda es inaceptable o que por lo menos te pongan esos servicios en el ticket y el establecimiento pinta ser algo en las fotos y deja mucho que desear. No lo recomiendo para nada"
VERDE BY YEEELS,3.0,3,2,4,5,"We went there on Christmas Eve. Welcome, ambiance, and service was good, but the food quality was drastically below expectations. Her pasta felt like a kids meal, and my steak was well cooked but hard and really low quality beef.
They don‚Äôt offer wine by the glass, that is really bad when one person in a couple does not drink.
When closing the tab, the waiter asked for 20% 25% or 30% tip, knowing we are international clients when the local customs dictate a lot less.
Overall it is an overhyped place, where the food does not match the image they project."
VERDE BY YEEELS,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Very disappointing experience - we are giving one star because we cannot give negative. Food quality, service and atmosphere were really bad. Waitresses were dressed as if you were in a strip club. The prices they charge are extortionately high for their service. We highly recommend they use the money the charged us to buy more appropriate attire for their employees. Avoid booking there unless you want to spend money unnecessarily."
VERDE BY YEEELS,5.0,5,5,5,5,"This place is incredible.  One of the best spots in Paris for sure.  The food, service and ambiance made the perfect combination for an amazing night out."
VERDE BY YEEELS,5.0,5,5,5,5,Amazing experience and we will definitely come back to Paris to visit Verde
VERDE BY YEEELS,1.0,1,1,1,1,The staff were very rude and it was disappointing
VERDE BY YEEELS,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Outstanding food & service, Music was on point and ramped up to the right levels.
Would highly recommend"
VERDE BY YEEELS,4.0,4,4,4,3,"Very nice ambience, food was delicious, good customer service, and the food came out quickly"
VERDE BY YEEELS,5.0,5,5,5,5,It is one of my favorite dining experiences. The food was amazing.  Staff made the experience even better.  Don't skip the dessert. The seasonal  vegetables with pesto are the best I've ever eaten.
VERDE BY YEEELS,5.0,5,5,5,5,Verde was one of the highlights of out European vacation.
VERDE BY YEEELS,1.0,1,1,1,4,"Food was not good if your looking for quality.
Food was not served hot."
VERDE BY YEEELS,5.0,5,3,5,4,"It was nice.  The duck was way over cooked, I order it medium rare and it came out like a leather shoe.  The music was too loud, but the staff weee really great.  Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôd go back, but it wasn‚Äôt a complete disaster either."
VERDE BY YEEELS,1.0,1,1,1,1,"I arrived a few minutes before my reservation and was told to wait in the bar until my table was ready. Went to the bar and after about 15 minutes of no one greeting me or offering a drink, I left. Seeing as though I was the only patron in the bar, it seemed very rude and I am still unclear Q's to why my table wasn't ready. The place did not seem that busy."

VERDE BY YEEELS,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Steps from Louis Vuitton on the Champs-√âlys√©es and the Arc do Triomphe. Security at the entrance, a small bar, and a delightful setting area on the first floor will be their welcome letter for an enchanting ambiance.

Delicious, quality, and gourmet food that is beautifully presented. The main room is located in a subterranean dining room filled with funky eclectic chandeliers, unique wallpaper, and candles that seems necessary to provide the necessary light for a dinner.

A live DJ keeps the energy and the music at an appropriate level that will go up and down depending on the vibe.

Reservation will be advised!"
VERDE BY YEEELS,1.0,1,1,1,1,"We arrived to this beautiful place and my wife and I were asked what we wanted at the door. I mentioned we had a reservation and the front security gave us a dirty look. He checked and then told us to wait outside and got someone else. The waitress or hostesses asked what do we need. It was rude to not even ask how they can help or even a hi, just simply ""yes?"". I explained I made a reservation and they said today is $150 per person for valentines, and asked if we can do that. We said, that's fine, we've paid more before. Showed us the menu and we agreed. They asked to wait then told us, we're not dressed up to their standards. They kept thinking of excuses to not let us in and it's ruined our valentines because everywhere else was already booked. Not sure if it was our skin, or our young selves but we hated how we were treated and were not given respect as a human being. We ended up with a better night elsewhere and good riddance."

VERDE BY YEEELS,5.0,5,5,5,5,This place was absolutely beautiful! Excellent service/ superb cocktails & food and the restaurant‚Äôs overall aesthetic  appearance was exquisite!!
VERDE BY YEEELS,1.0,1,1,1,1,"An absolute disgrace the level of professionalism by the people there. I have eaten all over the world and in the best restaurants from 3 Michelin stars to a simple pub in a corner and never have I seen such disrespect and slow class. 

I underhand why it wasn‚Äôt full. Honestly a shame, thankfully as I was staying in the 4 seasons I got to go to a better more expensive restaurant."
VERDE BY YEEELS,5.0,5,5,5,5,"First of all: DO NOT make a reservation with OpenTable for this restaurant. They had no record of our reservation but because we went there when they opened they seated us anyway. 

The rest was a truly incredible experience. The 4 of us ordered a third of the menu and everything was exceptional including the service. I totally recommend it but I also urge you to make the reservation directly otherwise you most likely won't have a booking when you get there."

VERDE BY YEEELS,5.0,5,5,5,5,"AMAZING RESTAURANT- staff, ambiance, and food were all 5 star"
VERDE BY YEEELS,2.0,2,2,2,5,"We went here for Valentine‚Äôs Day from LA. The ambiance of the restaurant was 8/10. It very much felt fun and like a lounge. The music was also on point! 

The food and service on the other hand was another story. We ordered a filet and the truffle penne pasta. The filet was tiny and the pasta was flavorless with the exception of the truffle. Given it was Valentine‚Äôs Day, they had a special menu that included an entre and a dessert. We got the chocolate mousse. The chocolate mousse wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ chocolate mousse. Our server mentioned it was their spin on chocolate mousse which was heavy cream with ice in it and chocolate sauce on top. Odd. The food overall was very overpriced, lacked flavor, and generally underwhelming. There was a staff miscommunication as well. When we arrived the hostess mentioned 1 drink was included in the Valentine‚Äôs Day meal and the server mentioned it as well, so we ordered it. When we got the check‚Ä¶ it was another story and it was apparently not included? Maybe language barrier? 

Overall, the vibe of this place is great, but the food and service will leave you confused and seeking more."
VERDE BY YEEELS,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Terrible. We booked by Open Table, tried to call the restaurant and the answerphone said it was full and couldn‚Äôt take any more messages, paid 20 euros for a taxi to get there only to find the place clearly not properly open, with decorator materials everywhere.

Either the restaurant or Open Table messed up badly, saying they were open for business - they weren‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt have been bookable, and we had a wasted evening!  Reader beware!"
VERDE BY YEEELS,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Open table app accepted the reservation. 
We arrived there and restaurant was closed, as all other restaurants in Paris.
If they are closed open table app should not accept and confirm the reservation."

VERDE BY YEEELS,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Magical introduction to Paris. Great food, cool ambience and yummy cocktails."
VERDE BY YEEELS,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Awful. Horrible. Gross. Overpriced. Check your bill, then check it again. 

Over charged us for everything. Put extra drinks on our bill, up charged us for the ones we had. 
The food was mediocre, at best. 
Mice everywhere. 
When we pointed out the mice their response, ‚ÄúWelcome to Paris, it‚Äôs like Ratatouille‚Äù
Waiter was incompetent, the manager was rude. Offered no sort of resolution until we noted we would just take it up with Amex then they took a few drinks off the bill when they should have just comped the meal. 
Do not waste your time going to this awful place!"
VERDE BY YEEELS,4.0,4,3,3,3,Enjoyed our meal however meal was ruined after waiter poor side sauce over dish before I had chance to stop him. I still finished my meal but wasn't overly impressed. The service was good other than that.
VERDE BY YEEELS,3.0,3,2,4,5,Food was well prices and I suppose you pay for what you get. Food wasn‚Äôt bad but not amazing. Overpowering flavours that weren‚Äôt right in my opinion. The octopus was amazing though.

M√∫sica 100!!"
VERDE BY YEEELS,3.0,3,3,2,5,"We had a reservation on NYE and coming from Los Angeles to celebrate our engagement. We got a call a few days prior with them canceling, but due to the language barrier we couldn‚Äôt understand why. No problem, we assumed they had a special event. Followed up with an impromptu visit a few evenings later, hostess was excellent. Friendly, sweet and polite. Decor beautiful. Unfortunately the credit card machines were down, but our server didn‚Äôt tell us until the end of the meal and sent my fianc√© walking in search of an ATM that was not, just outside on the right. It was very slow being after NYE and the drink service was very slow, but food service very fast. Salmon was fishy, tartar underwhelming, but ceviche was excellent as was the truffle mashed potato. The salad was good. We asked for change from our server and she never brought it back, but we think she either didn‚Äôt hear us or didn‚Äôt understand. All in all, living in West Hollywood, we knew what to expect. Good evening, but dissatisfied with the salmon. It‚Äôs an easy dish, and being they were out of the ravioli, a bummer to have it be so fishy. But you go to these types of restaurants for the ambience and the DJ was excellent."
VERDE BY YEEELS,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Went for New Years and everything was perfect! From the moment we walked in the service was first class. Never felt rushed but they were always there when we wanted someone. The food was amazing! We often dine in the best places in London and New York, this was right up there with the very best. The beef was perfect! The ambiance was spot on, all in all, a really great experience!"

VERDE BY YEEELS,2.0,2,3,3,2,"Style over substance. The food was OK but for the price it was very disappointing. Staff were fine, but it felt more like we were in a low-key nightclub than a nice restaurant."
VERDE BY YEEELS,4.0,4,3,4,3,Nice late night spot for dinner with a South Beach music vibe that wasn‚Äôt overpowering.  Service was pleasant and informative. Menu is complete without being overbearing.  A solid value in a city with many option.

Asked for a happy hour wine but was charged 9.75 euros for a small glass.

Eaten at sereral hrc restaurants recently and loved them all - unfortunately, Paris fell very short."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,This was your typical Hard Rock Cafe. The food servings were very large and the chicken I had was quite nice. The dessert was just way too much and too large of a portion. But generally it was a nice dining experience.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Definitely a recommendable Hard Rock Caf√©. Excellent service, delicious food. The waiter did an excellent job. Thank you!!"

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,3,1,3,I have visited Hard Rock in Paris 25/12 and unfortunately for me and my companions it was the worst experience in Hard Rock within Europe. The waitresses advised that there was a technical issue with the mashine of Coca Cola and it might be no tasteful. We have ordered Caesar‚Äôs salad and for technical issue they weren‚Äôt able to deliver the salad and at the end advised that are not able to service any deserts. Our waitress named Chiarra was very polite and always with a smile. However I will not recommend Hard Rock in Paris
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Il nostro tavolo era di fronte alla cucina e a fine pasto vestiti e Giacconi puzzavano pesantemente. Bisognerebbe creare una barriera divisoria, a parte questo problema il resto √® andato tutto bene."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Antonio was an excellent waiter!  He works here seasonally so we were lucky to get him as our waiter
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,4,"BBQ ribs are always very good. 
The only problem is that we can't order anymore a Half rack. A full rack is too much for a lunch for one person.

Consequently I will not order a full rack when on my own , so I  will visit less often ( until you have the club sandwich  and haystack salad and unsweeted ice tea back)

Why are you creating problems for your customers and losing them in sight?  Mystery to me!
You are too focussed on your internal  HQ  issues, in all hard rocks I visited. The team in Paris is one of the best. Set them free!"

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"great service and delicious food, must try it with your fam!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,3,We had a reservation for dinner at 9:30 pm and when ordering food they told us that the bread for the burgers was out.  So we were forced to choose the few dishes that didn't include bread. In a capital like Paris I find this to be very serious and unacceptable!  We will never return!
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,A friend who is gluten and dairy free was with us and they were able to amend dishes and offer advice. So helpful and friendly. Great food and a perfect start to a night out!

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Table booking worked well. Greeted and shown to our table. A couple of birthday parties but food was served quick and very hot. Missed the tower of onion rings but bought those along soon after a reminder. Great Messi menu for the kids and the usual cocktails for the adults. Booking is needed as full most nights.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,2,2,"Note a nice atmosphere as you saw in other hard riock caf√© restaurant. Very disappointed by everything.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,3,5,5,"Excellent! Bravo pour le service Myriam. Nous avons pass√© un excellent moment merci au service attentif.
Je trouve que la nourriture doit par contre s'am√©liorer. L'hamburger de Messi n'√©tait pas √† point, comme command√©. Je pense qu'elle pourrait √™tre meilleur, pour un produit phare... √† 22 euros, il faut faire un effort extra.
Le restaurant est tr√®s joli."

Non mi √® stato spiegato ma sono stata obbligata a lasciare a mia scelta una percentuale, ma io non voglio pagare per qualcosa che non sono abituata a vivere, sono italiana e da noi la mancia √® facoltativa, da quando in Francia √® obbligatoria?"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The food isn‚Äôt cheap, however the portions are HUGE so no need to pay for starters. Save room for pudding and if you are ordering the brownie Sunday, definitely share with someone."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,2,5,5,"While I‚Äôm a frequent Hard Rock Cafe customer, and the lovely Laura did everything she could, the drinks were good, but the food wasn‚Äôt. The baby back ribs were ok, the ribeye steak was very dull in taste (but cooked to perfection) and the mashed potatoes that goes along just didn‚Äôt resemble Parisian mashed potatoes.
Besides that, I have some problems with my hearing after this visit as every birthday celebration came with lots of shouts and someone hitting a metal bucket. This experience isn‚Äôt fun even for the birthday boy.
Overall ok but not gonna come back. They need to learn how to do it from the Barcelona site."

Tr√®s bizarre... j'y suis retourn√© le lendemain matin (5‚Ç¨ de metro et 2h de perdu...), ils m'ont fait l'√©change... heureusement... J'ai v√©rifi√© le rayon, il n'y avait que des sweet PARIS...

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,2,4,1,"After Picadilly and Amsterdam visited in August 2023 with my soon, the HR Paris looks like a 15th century tavern.
Suprisingly food was good unlike Amsterdam and London where the burguers were dry and hard as stone. The burguer in Paris was tender and juicy, however decoration is old and worn it is not beautiful. 
Picadilly and Amsterdam decoration looks brand new however food has definitely no quality !
We were 2 (me and my soon) in the 3 HR caf√© me and my and we have spent around 150euros each visit."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,5,Service was perfect. Laura was very friendly and helpful. Only disappointment was no local burger available.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,2,3,"Maybe they‚Äôre understaffed, I don‚Äôt know. But difficult to get their attention when needed. 
When we sat, the waiter said he‚Äôll be back in a couple of minutes giving us time to review the menu. 10 mins later, he was no where to be found. Had to call another. The same continued till we paid the bill and left."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,3,"Our waiter (Collin) was super nice to us, always asking if everything was alright. The portions were exaggeratedly big, so maybe I'd prefer if the price was lower and less quantity of food. I disliked that the restaurant was so noisy."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,2,5,1,"La carne estaba tan dura y tan mala que me sent√≥ fatal. Hab√≠a m√∫sica en vivo, eso bien. Pero a un volumen como si fuera un concierto. Imposible cenar en paz. Para hablar con el camarero a ""grito pelao"". Menos mal q fui sola a cenar, pq olv√≠date de hablar con tu acompa√±ante."

Too much expensive.
It doesn't worth the experience"

The food was served fast and at a good temperature. Nice ambiance and great place to eat. We went for the Messi burger and it was delicious."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,2,1,3,"Worst Hard Rock experience to date.
Food has deteriorated in quality greatly and is now mediocre at best.
Waitress was pleasant when there, but we had to look for service on a few occasions for example to order more drinks and get cutlery for our main course."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,3,4,4,"Had a great night here being served by Homeboy.  It was my sons birthday and Homeboy made the night for him.  ...plus he enjoyed the Wings and Messi burger.

More restaurants could do with a Homeboy !!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,2,3,1,"Grandissima delusione per la musica completamente inesistente, il servizio non premuroso (mancavano posate e abbiamo dovuto chiederle) e i prezzi che hanno raggiunto livelli molto alti per la qualit√† espressa. L‚Äôatmosfera dell HRC si sta perdendo in modo clamoroso. Peccato, si rischia di distruggere un mito: il R‚Äôn‚ÄôR √® quasi sparito."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Food was lovely, service was great Antonio made us so welcome and at easy very friendly"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Our server, Homeboy, was amazing! He deserves every star available! He made our stay, to celibrate our honeymoon, a moment to remember!
The Food was great, even for us as Weight watchers üòä"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,3,3,"+ friendly and good service
+ classic Hard Rock Cafe style

- poor food quality (medium patty half raw, chicken dry and even partly hard)
- very poor price-value 

Food quality wise the worst Hard Rock Cafe yet. 
Paris offers much better food less or the same same price anywhere else. 

Sadly a very disappointing experience.."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,5,4,A real Hard Rock experience! Always a coming home feeling during travels. One of the questions before was about the noise that was pretty loud but not with music. We only heard other people! Would have been nice to hear less neighbors and more of the music hereüòä
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,2,1,"The worst hard rock I‚Äôve been todate! Server had no interest, lacked any hard rock vibe, just boring, and for ‚Ç¨155 wish I had of went elsewhere!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Always a great time at HRC! Fun food and service was timely. Impressed with the memorabilia collection in Paris.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,3,1,5,"Ho girato alcuni HRC in Europa. Il sevizio √® famoso per essere rinomato per l gentilezza e precisione. Purtroppo qui non √® stato cos√¨. Chi ci ha servito, purtroppo, ci ha accusato di aver aver chiesto un cocktail con un altro quando, in verit√†, lo abbiamo indicato con il dito. Da quel momento il sevizio √® stato sotto la media. Porzioni sotto alla media di quelle che avevo visto e che mi aspettavo. Rimane pur sempre un HRC‚Ä¶"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,2,1,2,"Server was very unpleasant.
Messi burger served cold...
Quite a long time haven't been there.... Never go back again."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,5,4,"Homeboy made our meal‚Ä¶ one of the best servers we‚Äôve ever had, made a meal out with kids after being in 30 degree heat all day amazing! Loved the nachos also üíï"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,2,3,"Our son with coeliakie noticed he got a normal hamburger although he ordered glutenfree. As in all of Paris you get no value for money. We are used to Amsterdam prices, half of what you pay here. Staf is also very pushy when it comes to tipping and if you ordered first at the bar, you have to tip twice.."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,5,5,"Nice, cosy, good music, food and drinks. Try the ribs :)"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,4,Toujours une bonne exp√©rience les Hard Rock Caf√©.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,5,Personale gentilissimo. Il migliore hamburger mangiato a Parigi. Atmosfera Hard Rock. Prezzi un p√≤ pi√π alti della media. Consigliato.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,5,5,Nice place and good music! The price was adequate for Parsi standards
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,2,2,Kids seated next to us were very much a distraction
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,5,5,3,Hard rock cafe is a very good restaurant but even in this place thieves are roaming around. One of our friend lost his bag while we are eating. Always keep an eye of your belongings. There are client thieves unfortunately in Paris.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"It was a good experience for our son (9), but I feel that you are paying for the name and not the food, although our food was nice."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,2,3,Wrong food order was brought over to the table. Then to be told that they had no vegetables which was one of the sides we ordered. Food was dry and cold
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,1,4,4,"Au menu du saumon choisi : les haricots verts n'√©taient pas cuits !! Immangeables
Le pur√©e n'√©tait pas de bonne qualit√© avec des morceaux d'√©pluchures !!
D√©cevant"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Homeboy was our server and he was beyond brilliant. Made us all feel super comfortable and a lovely last day of our holiday. :))
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,1,2,"We visit Hard Rocks all over the world and this was by far the worst.
Uninterested staff, we arrived at the time of the booking- table not ready. When finally ready, someone else was sitting there. Food took forever to arrive and not whole menu was available. 
Not Hard Rock worthy!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Sehr freundliches Personal. Wir wurden freundlich bedient. Das Essen war sehr gut.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,5,4,"Again we had a good time at the hard rock caf√©. The foods great and staff was very helpfull.
One minor thing was that the cheese and bacon fries didn‚Äôt have any bacon. Or I missed it ‚Ä¶ but don‚Äôt think so."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,4,3,"Like every HardRock caf√© the food was good. The staff was friendly and the things to see where good.

It is a pity that it is very expensive to buy some t-shirts, so we did not."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,Make a booking to ensure you are able to dine at the time you wish
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Das Essen war sehr schlecht, Cheeseburger gut durchgebraten bestellt, war noch blutig. Salat war ohne Dressing. Als wir die Bestellung beanstandet haben, kam keine Reaktion au√üer sorry."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Very good team in HR Paris ! Our waiter Rocky was perfect !
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"A great restaurant, feels more like the florida one than any other we have been to. As always excellent service"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,It was ver special and nice! We love the Hard Rock Cafe in Paris
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,5,1,2,"Me da mucha pena, adoro hard rock , siempre que viajo visito los hard rock. He estado en muchos, y este es el peor. Muy mal servicio, nada de cordialidad, en fin, al menos la comida estubo bien(mas de 2 horas para cener con cita) Lo unico que salva el local es la Stta. Antra, gran profesional"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,1,5,3,"The food is awful. The place is noisy, we can't hear each other. But the restaurant is really charming and the home boy was nice."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,5,4,"Food good, service good but toilets need a good clean and there was no loo roll in ladies toilets at all."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Luca was the nicest waiter 
:-) everything was fine....music a little too loud"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,4,2,"Purtroppo, pur avendo con grande anticipo tramite sito, un tavolo per due persone ci hanno assegnato un tavolo in una parte del ristorante dove non c'era aria condizionata o comunque molto caldo perch√© di fronte alla CUCINA vicinissima. Siamo tornati a casa con una pizza incredibile di fritto."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,2,4,4,"It‚Äòs too expensive for such little servings! Our kids are very thin, but they laughed as they saw their burgers. We also have waited approx. 50 min. for our dinner‚Ä¶that‚Äús too long‚Ä¶"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,2,3,2,"Prices are much over rated for the food. I find 25‚Ç¨ for a Salad a complete rip off. The sandwiches and Burger prices are also very high.

The server first informed us of missing items, and when we finally ordered and received the food, we complained about missing guacamole, he replied: ""i told you it was missing today"" but it was not in the items he mentioned.

Food delivery was very much disorganized. We waited for 45 minutes for our dishes (despite the fact that the restaurant was FAR from being full. Many tables free on our floor, and the upstairs was closed (no customer). Once the dishes finally arrived, our 6 year old son did not have his dish and he had to wait an additional 10 minutes. No easy to explain a little boy that not only does everyone have to wait for a very long time, but for him it is even longer. 

Finally, i would have thought that with the prices of the Burgers and the high reputation of Hard Rock Cafe, an American Brand.. that the food would be up to the level. But it was a strong disapointement. Burger was not great, fajitas were not good, Mac & Cheese were cold (maybe explained by the delayed delivery at our table). 

All in all, i wanted to have a nice lunch with my Kids, and bring them to a fun place, all i got was stress as i had to rush to eat my dish before i would go back to work."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,4,"First time at HRC in Paris. Not a great atmosphere overall, mostly families. People leaving early, almost empty at 9.30 pm.
On the other hand, same food we came for and some super helping guys working there.
Thanks Colin!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Superservice. Great food. Nice cocktails. Missed Queen. Nice shop.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,3,3,Reeds in meerdere Hard Rock caf√©s geweest. Eten was prima! Bediening iets minder dan gewend. We moesten vragen om de refill van de drankjes. Jammer genoeg boven gezeten
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,3,5,"Es ist ganz sch√∂n teuer geworden in Hard Rock Cafe. Qualitativ immer noch gut, aber f√ºr einen Burger mit Pommes √ºber 20 ‚Ç¨ zu zahlen, ist grenzwertig. Wenn man dann nach der Bestellung fast eine Stunde aufs Essen warten muss, kommt nicht gerade Freude auf. Die Zwiebelringe wurden mit Verzug von 5 Minuten gebracht. Bedeutet meine waren noch lauwarm und die meiner Frau hei√ü. Schlecht. Auch die Getr√§nkeprelse waren √ºberzogen. F√ºr 33 cl Cola fast 6 Euro. So gern ich das HRC mag‚Ä¶das war erstmal der letzte Besuch."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,3,2,"Experience tr√®s mitig√©e pour cette visite alors que nous sommes des habitu√©s. L'ambiance au RDC est assez tristounette et l'accueil moins engageant et dynamique qu'√† l'habitude. L'attente est tr√®s longue ! Pas de pochette rockstar pour les enfants, du coup l'attente se fait encore plus ressentir. Une attente encore interminable pour le dessert...m√™me le burger est moins bon que d'habitude avec une viande violac√©e et un pain compl√®tement imbib√©. Quelle d√©ception pour cette visite !"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,4,3,Vriendelijk personeel en goed gegeten. Lekkere cocktails

Just missing the old time favorites ( spring rolls, club sandwich, Texan Chipotle pulled pork, Haystack salad, and HOMEMADE cheesecake  etc)."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"I booked this a 18th birthday celebration for my niece. I messaged on here and was told we would have a good table and also requested a cake.
On arrival we had an awful table and the lady was not aware of any celebration. They said we could not move. We waited for 15 min and no one came to take out drinks order, we then left."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,3,1,4,"We had a reservation  for HR Paris and we arrived in time. We were put at one table and someone came to ask us about the order. 
First problem: nobody told us that there is a promo going on - we had both HR tee-shirts and we would have benefited from 10% of discount. But we only found out after leaving the restaurant when a nice lady from the shop told us about it.
Second problem - the biggest one: 
When sitting at the table drinking our cocktails, a lady came to tell us that we have not the right to set there and that other clients have the table. She was not elegant in talking, she rolled her eyes and told us that we have to move at the bar. 
We asked for the manager to come, who indeed arrived for presenting apologies and for offering us a free desert.
Anyway, the overall experience was the worst of all the Hard Rock cafes visited.
The impression is that they consider guests as occasional clients who will never come back an can be treated anyhow. 
Will not go again, even if we are regular customers of the chain."

(Clothes we wanted to buy were also sold out in our size)"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,2,2,A big disappointment. Some of the Food on the menu was not available. Food was not cooked to our order and we had to send it back. Cocktails didn‚Äôt meet our expectation.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,2,2,"Very overpriced food and drinks. I wouldn't have minded paying so much if the food was special or had a wow factor but I could have made the same meal at home. 
Our server seemed preoccupied, there wasn't much of an atmosphere.
Very disappointed and I will never return to a Hard Rock Cafe."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,5,5,"good lunch .Our new waiter didn't know about the ""classic "" nachos  ( no uggly processed food 4 cheese blend, but double the cheese). I explained it and we got what we wanted.  please spread the world !Lunch was great as usual .

problems:
As you dont' have anymore the traditional unsweetned legendary  ice tea, we took tap water. Another sale missed for you , sorry guys.

The ribs were not ready for lunch. Unfortunate because after the crap menu change froma 15 onths ago or so , that about the last item for which I 'm coming to HRC. I managed with the southwestern salad ( overpriced though)
  Best regards

Eric"

Only 2 people on the bar all night (for tables and bar service).
To be fair the front of hours was nice (if harassed) and waiter was fine. Just way too few staff"

Nous avons du expliquer au couple que malheureusement, n'ayant pas suivi le protocole, personne de cet √©tablissement ne viendra vers eux... La serveuse a finalement pris le temps d'√©changer avec eux, au bout d'une heure le couple a quitt√© le restaurant...sans y avoir consomm√©. 
Si non, Le d√©lai d'attente pour la r√©ception de l'addition a √©t√© quasi nul alors que le d√©lai d'attente pour la r√©ception des consommations a √©t√© tr√®s long."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,2,2,1,First thing we learned was that several meals wete not available‚Ä¶
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,2,3,1,"Schlimme Akustik, St√ºhle und Tische extrem eng beieinander"

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,A wonderful experience for my daughter‚Äôs 12th anniversary.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,4,4,2,"La personne qui s'occupe de cocher les r√©servations √† l'arriv√©e √©tait parfaitement impolie et condescendante. Je ne comprends pas qu'elle soit la vitrine et l'accueil de votre restaurant. Quant √† la musique d'ambiance, on a l'image mais pas le son, c'est dommage car les t√©l√©viseurs diffusent des clips et des concerts dont on ne profite plus.
The person in charge of checking reservations on arrival was downright rude and condescending. I do not understand that it is the showcase and the reception of your restaurant. As for the background music, we have the image but not the sound, it's a shame because the televisions broadcast clips and concerts that we no longer enjoy."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,The staff is very friendly and the food is amazing !!!!
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,4,3,"Well, I think that the quality of the food it has decreased. The blue cheese is not the same, the flavour of the wings is not the same also. We went one Wednesday because of the Hard rock live thing, but it was cancelled , then, we lost the oportunity to live that experience."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,3,4,J ai fait plusieurs Hard rock caf√© et celui ne m a pas laiss√© un souvenir de fou. On arrive 5 personnes a l accueil du resto dont 4 qui rigolent entre eux sans te  dire bonjour. Quelques produits plus en stock. Un peu de√ßu globalement...
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,4,3,"Pour avoir fait celui de San Francisco, je trouve celui de Paris tr√®s petit et il manque un peu d'√¢me rock...
Un peu d√©√ßue car j'avais gard√© un super souvenir de San Francisco
Paris √† faire si on n'a jamais fait d'autres Hard Rock caf√©"

Too expensive"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,1,3,"Although we had a reservation and arrived on time at the restaurant, we had to wait 20 Minutes for our table!
After we finished our meal the waiter asked for coffee or dessert. We denied and a few moments later we got the bill (eventhough we didnt ask for it yet). For us a clear sig n, that we are not welcome anymore. This was not that friendly. We were sitting at our table for not more than one hour and they take leave of us like this."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,We had an amazing experience from start to finish. We arrived 30 mins early and they allowed us to sit and eat when we arrived. Our waiter ‚ÄúChatty‚Äù was fantastic and he couldn‚Äôt do enough for us and he made us laugh with his humour. The food was amazing and Paris is one of the best Hard Rocks we have been to.

4 plats command√©s et 1 qui arrive 10mn apr√®s les 3 autres. 
Pour le prix pas terrible."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,3,4,3,Had booked months in advance and was disappointed to find tables not cleared away and been pushed to aside table. 2 out of 3 meals were ok. The buffalo chicken sandwich was dry and cold so most of it was left.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,1,5,attesa troppo lunga e dopo un‚Äôora si sono accorti che non c‚Äôera arrivato nulla e di essersi sbagliati. Dopo l‚Äôennesima sollecitazione ci sono arrivati i piatti e non erano nemmeno eccellenti.

Sehr nettes und aufmerksames Personal welches Freude bei der Arbeit hat. Es war eher k√ºhl im Restaurant und hatte Durchzug, deshalb nur 4 Sterne."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Nice meal, tender spare ribs and pulled pork, very friendly staff and lovely music!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,2,3,"Our server didn't tell us there were no beans, gave my husband coleslaw when he is lactose intolerant!
Our server was being trained but she would have been better without the trainer.
Internet in the venue is awful so couldn't share experience with friends or log onto my Unity App!
Groups of staff having laugh around the kitchen when we were waiting to to order and couldn't get their attention.
Having visited a large number of Hard Rock cafes this was by far the worse."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Our waitress was able to speak good English so communication was good the manager was very friendly and the food was good.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We arrived a little late due to the Uber driver so we were worried. Those worries were quickly replaced when we saw the smiles on the faces of the energetic hosts who greeted us at the door. We were sat quickly and our server came right over to introduce himself. His name was Homeboy and I highly suggest you request his section if you come here. Not only was he very attentive, our many request for substitutions and additions didn‚Äôt seem to bother him at all. With a table of three women from the USA (Michigan) I can admit we were a lot to deal with, but Homeboy assured us that he was there for us and he understood that we may not want our food exactly as it was presented on the menu. In addition to our interactions with Homeboy, the manager and other servers were ready and willing to assist us with whenever we needed anything. They even sung happy birthday to me and presented me with a complimentary ice cream Sunday!  We even got a little taste of home  when they played a song by Eminem! Overall, everything at Hard Rock Cafe was perfect. This was an awesome experience on my birthday my first time in Paris that I will never forget!  I highly recommend visiting the Hard Rock Cafe when in Paris!"

Le burger est juste excellent"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,4,"We are addicted to Hard Rock Caf√©s . The food is always outstanding. 
The music always too loud to allow a conversation. :-p
 Maybe at lunch it could be softer.
Restrooms (in Paris) need maintenance"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,3,4,"Food lacked any kind of flavour. Such a shame, ambiance was fine."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,4,Great service and tasty food. Just a shame the upstairs space was not available as it was quite drafty and not very private downstairs.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,5,Nice ambiance ! As always quality food and music !
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,2,1,3,"1) Waiting in front of the long reception before installing. 
2) Service problem more gas in the kitchen waiting to restore and no offer for the wait or goodwill.
3) Too expected from the reception, the service and the wait for the meal.
4) Food for children poor and bland.
5) Arrival on site from 12:50 p.m. in front of the reception, pick-up from 1:05 p.m., waiting for the meal 30min and end of restaurant at 2:50 p.m. for a dish!
6) I recommend Hard Rock Cafe in Lyon to a friend and not in Paris. Given the poor Hard Rock Cafe service in Paris, delay and no commercial gesture."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I love the overall vibe of the Hard Rock Cafe and their employees. I would definetly go back, their are my favorite franchise!"

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,5,5,"One meal arrived cold so had to be sent back. The replacement took that long one meal was finished from the order and the other persons had gone cold from waiting. 

The servers were however fantastic just the whole experience was ruined due to
The food. Two people left without eating"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,3,1,1,"We booked a table for 19.30 and arrived on time to be told our table wasn‚Äôt ready. We waited 45 minutes and eventually took a table in the bar which as we hadn‚Äôt visited Paris before was disappointing. Service was slow. No one came to offer more drinks or desserts. We asked for our bill.., after a considerable amount of time the girl came back and asked us what we had asked for was it drink ? We said no the bill. After another considerable wait another girl came with the bill and we paid .,She  was clearly very annoyed and threw my credit card onto the table after I had paid and walked away without saying a word. I would say this Hard Rock Cafe was the worst we have visited. Not up to the normal friendly service. Very disappointing ."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,5,5,"As usual our luch was great, the quesadilla is a nice addition to the menu. The lunch Lime pie is good but taste more like a regular lemon pie than a lime pie. service was outsanding thanks to Agnieska . We also had the pleasure to chat with the General manager who is very customer friendly. To cut it short: a great experience, I'll be back ! EC"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,5,4,"great lunch as usual with my american friend, and we have been greatly welcomed  by a native guy from Brooklyn, NY! Ribs are still outstanding, and my favorite with spicy buffalo wings.

I regret that the club sandwich , the hay stack salad and the Texan Bbq Chipotle pulled pork has disappeared. Therfore I go there less often.

Too bad the Key Lime pie wazs not available. Next time..."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Staff very kindly,  good food and the service is fast and efficient, good vibes."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Ottima cena in un posto pieno di cimeli del rock molto belli
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,3,1,"We booked a table for 19h30. We ordered the ribs, but after a while our waiter told us they didn‚Äôt have ribs anymore. No problem at first, but than our waiter told us they were out of almost everything: fajitas, chicken, steak and we could actually only order hamburgers. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs normal that they were out of everything at 20h00. Or they should‚Äôve told us before we entered."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Siempre disfruto la comida, en cualquier Hard Rock del mundo"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,4,1,"The worst Hard Rock restaurant I have visited. Overrated, expensive food (which I've know beforehand) and still the quality was awful. I had the Mac chicken and cheese, clearly microwaved! My daughter's burger was smaller compared to other Hard Rock restaurants and again the quality not as expected. Much better options available in Paris!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,3,"I went to Hard Rock Paris on december 31st at 15:30 with my husband. The Restaurant was empty, and because I did not have a Reservation for that Day, the host said we couldn't have lunch. The Restaurant was open until 18:00 that day and we was prohibit to enter and eat three hours prior to close. The host was very rude. Shame Hard Rock!! You don't like to work and earn money."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,5,4,Our waiter Antony was great. He was very attentive and got our order exactly right even with our many special requests. While the hard rock is no longer playing exclusively rock music it is still always a great atmosphere.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Always good at the hard rock .
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,3,2,"I was sure there would be a concert during the dinner instead there was music (also not rock) on tv screen. Atmosphere not so exciting, similar to burgers house. Not so good experience in Paris. I expected so much more."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,4,2,4,"Ich kenne bereits einige Caf√©s weltweit. Aber vielleicht liegt es auch an der Art der Leute da:

Es war teilweise chaotisch organisiert und es war kein richtiges Bier mehr vorhanden. 

Sagen wir mal so - ich wechsel jetzt mal die Lokalit√§t."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,4,3,Food has really poor quality Looks like they are completely relying on the name Hard Rock Cafe. Definitely no recommendation!
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,This was the best food that we had in Paris.   The kids loved the Messi burger. Everything was awesome.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,1,4,4,"We were so happy to have a reservation to eat our favorite meal but at 7pm, a lot of meals were not longer available. That was rather dissapointing."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excelente experiencia!
Las m√≠ticas BBQ Ribs en su mejor expresi√≥n, junto a la calida atenci√≥n de Antonio.
Hermosa noche en familia."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Lovely staff and great food. We had a fabulous dinner.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,4,4,"Visite obligatoire quand je passe √† Paris. Les plats sont tr√®s bon, ambiance agr√©able"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,2,4,3,Nous avons prix le burger v√©g√©tarien. Tr√®s d√©√ßu. Il etait sec sans sauces ni l√©gumes. Juste une feuille de salade. Pas de sauce √† c√¥t√©. En plus le steack avait plus un go√ªt de graisse qu'autre chose. Cela ne vaut pas du tout son prix qui est tr√®s √©lev√©. M√™me les frites √©taient pas top. A presque 25‚Ç¨ le burger c'est vraiment √©xag√©r√©.  M√™me le coca n'avait presque pas de bulles. Seul les nachos √©taient bon. Venu en d√©cembre 2022
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Jamais d√©√ßu au HRC.
Accueil parfait, nourriture au top.
Excellent repas"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Good and atmosphere on par with all other Hard Rock Cafe‚Äôs visited - Superb and Outstanding!
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,3,4,"Je n'y avais plus mis les pieds depuis 20 ans et force est de constater que √ßa a bien chang√©‚Ä¶ Une seule pi√®ce pour s'installer, en bas, alors que l'√©tage est vide, du coup √ßa fait un peu cantine et le temps d'attente en est d'autant rallong√©. En outre, on rentre par la boutique, de ce fait on se demande si on vient d√©jeuner ou acheter un t-shirt‚Ä¶ On avait r√©serv√© mais on a attendu 20 minutes qu'une table se lib√®re. Puis on nous a fait changer de place pour que la n√¥tre puisse se moduler en table de 8. Arriv√©s √† 13h, on en est reparti √† 15h15 alors qu'on n'avait pris qu'un repas ""basique"" (ap√©ro + burgers). 
Bref, tr√®s long. Heureusement, le service est agr√©able et les plats sont corrects. Mais la magie s'est perdue."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,4,1,4,"Cocktail bar unfortunately not acceptable for this kind of famous restaurant (I think that the margarita ingredients are well known to everybody), I reserved a table and I had to wait in any case 30‚Äô, drinking a cocktail that was water and sugar.
The worse HR experience ever"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,3,2,1,"It was freezing cold as they had an issue with their heating which they weren‚Äôt getting fixed until the following day. We asked our server to move table as we were the closest to the door and cold even with coats, she refused outright, yet spoke to the manager who moved us immediately without hesitation. The food arrived wrong and sent back twice before getting what we ordered, same with a set of drinks came out incorrect and needed to go back and the coffee came to us cold. I have been to several Hard Rock Cafes and Hotels all over the world but this was by far the worst experience I have received and was very disappointing when you know what kind of service to expect and get completely let down on all sides."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,It's a great restaurant very nice I was so happy to become with my family and the really good attention to the the people the client

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,4,4,"Service was great, food was good, ambiance was a little low key for a hard rock, I‚Äôve been to about 20 of them"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,5,1,4,"We were a party of 5 people but couldn‚Äôt book a table for more than 4 on the website. So we booked a table for 4. Upon arriving, we were told that it was not possible to have 5 people seated on a table of 4 and that we had to wait for a table of 6 to be free. After a 20 minute wait we were escorted to a table only to find out that our table was a table of 4 with an additional chair. We couldn‚Äôt understand why we had to wait 20 minutes to be eventually seated on a table we had actually booked. Even worse, the table next to us was a table of 8 on which a family of 5 were later comfortably seated by the staff. We should have the possibility to book tables of more than 4 on your website. And if that‚Äôs not possible for whatever reason we shouldn‚Äôt have to feel ¬´¬†lucky¬†¬ª to be seated at a table we already booked after waiting for 20 minutes."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Parfait, le service tr√®s bien. Passer une bonne soir√©e."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,3,"Todo correcto, pero el local no est√° bien ambientado. Es una capital europea y este Hard rock no est√° a la altura. Otros como el de andorra o Florencia, tienen un ambiente mucho m√°s logrado"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Haven't been to a hard Rock restaurant for a few years now, just as goodxas ever, and the cocktails were fabulous"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Our server was happy to assist, even with providing a colleagues phone charger so i could recharge my phone. He was patient with my 10 year old sons changes to food choices and offered some flexibility to option for the shared starter. Food good. Exceptional service!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Unfortunately, did not have World Cup matches even though they said they would. This is a management fault not individual contributors."

Veel keuze in glutenvrije maaltijden.
Helaas was de hamburger iets te hard gebakken."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,4,5,Everything was fine only the service was slow. Food taste is like always very good.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Staff really helpful and polite, supported me with directions regarding the Metro, disappointing my daughter was visiting Hard Rock for her birthday and she wasn‚Äôt given a token for her birthday like other places in the past"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,The staff was really professional and polite. They were really nice
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Brilliant atmosphere, great friendly, helpful staff, great food."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,3,5,4,Really great service and the food is what you would expect - nothing to write home about.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Always a great place to go.  We are regulars at The Hard Rock Caf√© Paris for over 20 years.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,We had a good evening out at the Hard Rock Cafe Paris. The waiter that served us was good and the food was of a good standard. There was a live band performing the evening we visited which was very good.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Was great for me and my kids. The waitress Elsa was super kind. Food great as always. This Cafe rocks !
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,2,2,"Die Nachos waren gut, wenn auch √ºberteuert, der nicht weniger unversch√§mt teure Burger trocken, fad, fast kalt und stellenweise deutlich zu viele ‚ÄûR√∂staromen‚Äú. Die BBQ-So√üe war gut, konnte die muffigen Pommes aber auch nicht retten. Getr√§nke wie in ganz Paris unfassbar teuer. Never again, eher McDonals."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Everything was perfect. Good moment at this restaurant and very good music, thanks :)"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,1,4,4,Burger cold and impossible to get the steak rare !
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,3,3,"Waitress not very helpfull. No reffils, asked for the dessertcard and getting my bill. I think this was the last time for Hard rock. The experience of HRC all over the world going downwards..."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,4,5,Ein sch√∂ner Abschluss unseres Paris-Urlaubs!
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,3,3,The food was over priced for what it was. You pay the price for the name.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"La experiencia fue bastante mala, puesto que no sirvi√≥ de nada tener reserva‚Ä¶ pues tuvimos que esperar igual que los que no la ten√≠an."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,3,3,"We arrived at a quiet time but still took some time for greeter to show us to our seats. The original waiter was very good and friendly. He left soon after we started and the new waitress seemed overwhelmed even though the restaurant wasn't very busy: maybe she didn't have many colleagues working although there seemed to be a lot of staff simply standing around. When we finished it took a while to get her attention for dessert so we decided to go
somewhere else. When we couldn't find her to get our bill we asked one of her colleagues who asked us if we could ask our waitress instead. This didn't seem like good customer service so was a disappointing end to a generally nice evening."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,4,5,"The food and the music are great. 
It wouldn‚Äôt hurt if some of the staff could smile a bit but it doesn‚Äôt ruin the overall experience. 
It has become almost mandatory to book a table. If not, waiting time can easily get to 2 hours depending on the days. 
I‚Äôll definitely be visiting this restaurant on my next trip to Paris."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,2,5,4,The item I usually get at hard rocks around the world was different here. And not better. We had to send an item back. Very nice waitress but food was not it. Drinks were good.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,5,4,The food was really good quality although the starters seemed to be quite expensive (only a few euros cheaper than the mains). The service was excellent.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food good but a little cold would of liked if it was hotter
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,4,3,"The menu was not overwhelming for choice, and the food when it came was very average."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,1,4,"Food was good, but disappointed with the service. Perhaps it's a French thing, but other than getting the initial order, serving it, trying to catch someone's eye for another drink, and the  getting the bill, no one checked on us at all.

After 1 hour waiting (no food yet arrived - very hot temperature) we asked to move to another table in the center of the room where the temperature seemed to be slightly better.
After 75 minutes from our arrival we were told that our order got lost since we moved from our original table (though we did not move by ourselves but we asked the waitress!! and the new table was 5 meters away from the original one!!!).
Finally, after more than 90 minutes, food arrived. It was good but not worthwhile"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,5,"Hard Rock is always a great place to eat, woth high quality food and a great vibe. The Paris branch is nocely set up and woth a good vibe. The service provoded by kenza was great - the friendliest we've recieved in Paris. The Caesar salad isn't as good as at other Hard Rocks, and it was pretty expensive compared to other places in Paris, but all in all a great experience."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,3,3,3,"Good was ok nothing special, no real memorabilia like in other hard rocks"

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,3,1,Our table was so close to the kitchen that we were drown in the bad smell of burnt oil. The Burger was not tasty at all. Bbq sauce was full of sugar. The worst hrc experience among others in the different parts of the world !

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,4,"Family trip to Paris off to a bad start we ordered 2 starters to share between 3 of us but we only received one then waited around 45 minutes for our main course only for the chips on 2 of them to be cold so they went back and waited another 15 minutes and the waitress came round to say she was leaving and realised that we didn‚Äôt have our chips by this time my burger was stone cold so I couldn‚Äôt eat it my son had his chips but I like to eat my meal (burger and chips) together so I didn‚Äôt have any main course, waitress was too interested in prattling around rather than concentrating on taking our order correctly and paying attention to what was going on 
Extremely poor service very unhappy"

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,4,3,"We arrived an hour early to our booking. We were able to sit near the bar and wait which was great. Once we were seated, our waiter asked where we were from, we said England and he nodded. His demeanor changed and didn't really chat to us like he did with his other tables.
 We were sat above the loud speaker (you should turn this down or move the speaker that is closest to the stairs to the washrooms). The food was great though."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,4,"A pertect moment with my family, cool place and people"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,2,4,"The service was slow. I asked for sauces and the waitress forgot and had to ask after waiting 10 minutes. Also, the food took over 45 minutes to arrive and we where not informed of the long wait. The food was bland at best and the burgers and fries where cold with a dry burger too. My partner had to use mayonnaise to make the burger edible."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,4,1,2,"We weren‚Äòt seated (despite a reservation) for 20 minutes even though the entire mezzanine was empty.
Then we were given no drinks menu - ordered food before drinks - with the water taking >30 minutes to get to our table. 
We‚Äòve been to many HRCs before and this was by far the worst experience. Not the real thing, unfortunately."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,We made an online reservation an hour before. That was smart and worked perfectly. Thanks to Eph‚Ä¶ we enjoyed your service. Go one like this!!! Danke

Le catalogue de musique √©tait un grand + 
Merci encore :)"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,2,1,2,"When arrived we was seated at our table quickly even though we was 30 minutes early. Our waitress Isabella came over to take our orders and at first came across very attentive, however she failed to mention how the pulled pork was out of stock meaning I was rushed to pick a second option. 
When the food arrived it was cold and the fries were bland and stale. The man that brought over our food ask if we‚Äôd like any condiment and when we asked for ketchup we found ourselves waiting for a while and then witnessed him continuing to serve. This resulted in my partner having to ask a waiter who passed by for some ketchup. 
Our originally waitress Isabella didn‚Äôt once check on us throughout our meal to insure everything was ok. She took our plates and didn‚Äôt offer us any type of menus for desserts or even offer the bill, she just walked off and proceeded to ignore our table for roughly 20 minutes. It was only down to us having to stop her and ask for the bill did she pay any attention. 
This is by far the worst experience I‚Äôve had at any hard rock and I would certainly not recommend or revisit it myself."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Visit to Paris,"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,2,4,1,"Bruyant, repas tr√®s (trop copieux) mais absolument pas qualitatif.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,3,1,1,"The service was terrible. 
Extremely slow, had to ask for the same thing several time, waitress didn‚Äôt know anything about the menu. Also if items on the menu/drinks unavailable. 
Not very ‚Äúgrande‚Äù for a a Hard Rock Cafe, just a couple of small tvs with music videos.
Overall very disappointing compared to other hard rocks.
Food served cold."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,3,2,1,We like to visit Hard Rock Cafe in any new city we visit that has one. This experience was mediocre - we waited a long time to be served; it was humid in the restaurant and the food was just ok. We've had great experiences at other Hard Rock Cafes.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Delicious food and good options even if you cannot eat gluten. Staff very friendly and helpful. Fun atmosphere and an excellent quality meal.  I've eaten at this HRC multiple times and it's always been an enjoyable experience.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,5,5,Food was amazing...mojito...nachos and  legendary burger...so good
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,4,1,3,"I must say I expected more than what I got. Don't get me wrong, food was very good. But here was also things that could have been better. The people working there didn't seem too happy to be serving us. When going to the bathroom I had to stop to not collide with a waiter who cut me off right in front of me. After we got the food it ssemed like they just forgot we were there. No one checked up on us until we payed and left. And the overall mood was pretty upsetting. The restaurant also didn't have all the dishes on the menu. Being such a huge brand and company I would have expected much more and I'm not celebrating a birthday there again."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,2,3,4,"The size of the nachos entry was good but it lack of flavour. The chicken in the BBQ combo was not so good as the pork and ribs: these last two were amazing. I feel that were too few options of entries to share on the menu when comparing other Hard Rock restaurants: it would be nice to have on the menu the classic combo that 4 or 5 types of food in smaller portions, it is perfect to share with friends. I miss this at this spot."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,5,My sister and I came to have dinner here and we were very excited. The waiters were all really lovely and the drinks were served very quickly. However the food took over 45 minutes to arrive which the lady informed us there was a hold back in the kitchen so the drinks were free with a free refill which was a really sweet gesture. Food was lovely- big portion sizes which match the price point. Really great vibe and scenary. Would come back
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,3,5,4,"Compared to other Hard Rock Cafes I have been to the Hard Rock Paris served the smallest portions of food, albeit nice. There was no option to not buy your cocktail glass when the bill arrived although it did state that you didn‚Äôt have to buy it on the menu."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,4,4,Awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,1,5,Looks like any other Hard Rock Cafe which is good. Our server wasn‚Äôt really there physically and mentally. He seemed lost. He got our order wrong twice and charged us for stuff we didn‚Äôt have
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,3,1,3,"We enjoyed our meal, but were disappointed to be served a cold cappucino, and to be overcharged for the one dessert ordered. I would not expect to experience these kind of issues from what is a global brand."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,4,"The service, the food, the interior: everything was perfect, thank you! The staff is really cool, friendly and helpful. I loved the signature cocktail ""Hurricane"". I will surely be back soon. The only thing I'd like to say, is about music. It would be good to have live music. I tried to find some events on the website, but it seems that there is nothing planned in summer... Maybe I'm mistaken. Anyway, I highly recommend this place, thanks again!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,2,3,2,"Premi√®re fois au hard rock caf√© et vraiment tr√®s d√©√ßu. Le lieu est sympa mais niveau ambiance ¬´¬†rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll¬†¬ª √ßa pourrait vraiment √©t√© mieux.. et un hamburger frite certes loin d‚Äô√™tre mauvais mais pour 20‚Ç¨ on s‚Äôattend au moins √† des frites maison. 
Peut √™tre que pour l‚Äôambiance c‚Äôest mieux d‚Äôy aller le soir, car nous y avons √©t√© le midi et √ßa donnait la sensation d‚Äô√™tre un attrape touriste. Sinon notre serveur √©tait tr√®s sympathique et le service tr√®s rapide.."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,2,4,4,"Had a reservation and still had to wait 25 minutes for our table.  Very sad selection of items on the menu for vegetarians and pretty much nothing for vegans.   My dinner was ok, food just meh.  Our waiter (Daniel) and the rest of the supporting staff were Superb.  The food came out fairly quickly, so that was nice since we had to wait so long for the table.   The live music was nice."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,5,4,"Einen Tisch f√ºr 4 Personen zu reservieren ist das Eine den dann auch zu bekommen, das Andere ... nach √ºber 1/2 Stunde Wartezeit haben wir ihn dann doch noch bekommen. So bekommt man Leute in den Laden.
Dann hat die K√ºche uns noch was anderes gemacht, als bestellt. Als wir den Service darauf aufmerksam gemacht haben, dass es nicht passt haben wir zwar als Entsch√§digung unsere Getr√§nke frei erhalten und zus√§tzlich noch ein gemeinschaftliches Dessert bekommen, aber uns w√§re es lieber gewesen, wenn alles einfach nur so gewesen w√§re, wie bestellt. Die Portionen sind √ºberschaubar. Geschmacklich ist es sehr gut. Der √ºberaus bem√ºhte Service rettet die Punkte!!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Scheduling made days in advance and arriving at the place we would have to wait for another 1h00, ridiculous the service of the establishment!!!!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,3,4,5,"The Hard Rock Cafe is about the experience and not necessarily the food. We went on a Wednesday evening for the live music, which was provided by an excellent young man playing the classics and contemporary rock songs. The food was fine and the table service was very good. The only issue was the 30 minute wait despite having reservations.  The selection in the store was very good."

Only the question dish or paying was not very comfortable for me. 
A relaxing stay means also to stay an listen without hurry."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,2,"Due to our dog (not allowed, which took us by surprise, as that was no problem at other restaurants in Paris) we had a lonesome table outside. Therefore no comments on the atmosphere inside and very noisy because of road. Very nice service."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,1,3,3,"To expensive, to less choice on the meine, food quality to bad"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,2,1,2,"The food took more than a hour to be served.
Only after a few complaints from us and from the waiter as well to the kitchen.
When we were about to leave the place, the food was served.
At least the restaurant recognize its mistake and did not charge us on the fajitas."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent and family friendly! Easily recommended! Must eat burgers!

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,2,4,"Nice food, after ordering a main and being told it had no nuts the manager came over and said we needed to change the order proceeding to call the lady at the table ‚Äòmore than fine‚Äô in a flirty manner which left her feeling awkward."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,4,3,Service was good and food good. Toilets on the other hand were awful
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,3,3,"The waitress was nice and checked on us. The happy hour drinks were good, but the bartender does not know how to make an old fashion. The food was cold. I got a grilled chicken sandwich and the chicken was luke warm and the bun cold. My husband's nachos were luke warm also. The only thing hot were the French fries."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Are waiter was great he hand long hair. But paris has too many taxes. But was worth it.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,1,1,To start with I got the reservation wrong but the staff managed to seat us anyway which is a big positive. However service was extreme show having to wait up to 40minutes for a drink. Food was very dry and rock hard. Was a very disappointing meal.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The food, service and atmosphere was excellent! Our server was absolutely spectacular!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Top!
Thank you very much
And thank you to Eph (our waiter)"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,2,2,2,Food arrived warm not hot and Messi burger bore little resemblance to picture. Had told Hard Rock it was my birthday but unlike other Hard Rocks they did not get team to celebrate at table nor provide a small ice cream which other Hard Rocks have always done. When collecting the cocktail glasses we bought with meal instead of cocktail glasses we were originally given pint glasses. When we complained we were told they would have to go downstairs to the store room to get cocktail glasses as if we were an inconvenience. Very disappointing all round and not comparable with other Hard Rocks we have visited throughout the world. We will never visit HR in Paris again.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,5,3,5,Though a Birthday Was mentioned at the Reservation nothing happened concerning the Birthday. The waiter Was a little overloaded with guests. Waiting time a little more as normal

The service was superb and the food was excellent. The manager Liam was so friendly and checked in our table a few times. It was such a great experience we went back for a second time during our trip on Sunday because they offer childrens entertainment. 

Highly recommend this restaurant!

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"C‚Äô√©tait parfait, comme toujours. Les serveurs sont rapides et aux petits soins. Ils n‚Äôoublient pas les demandes malgr√© le fait que parfois c‚Äôest charg√© de monde et ils sont souriants et accueillants. La qualit√© et quantit√© de nourriture en vaut bien sont prix. C‚Äôest copieux et gourmand et les cocktails sont tr√®s bons ;-)"

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"great lunch of two couples of Hard rock afficionados. Southwestern chicken salad and burgers were great. Thanks to Doom and Liam for their chat at our table.
Such a great team!

We are missing the club sandwich , hay salad and spring rolls to come back more often. why did they dissapear?"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Far below the Brand standards compared to F.e. London or other cities. 
Kitchen was chaotic and food was returned several times. 
We booked but got the smallest table almost in the kitchen, whereas other guests before us had no reservation but got a nice spot before we entered. 
Paris Hardrock Cafe disappointing experience üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•"

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,3,1,1,"Not impressed on this visit. The drinks were watered and flat, coke and Fanta both. The server seemed to be in a bad and irritated mood. The food was ok, overcooked and not very flavourful. My son went to Burger King on his way home!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,2,3,"Waitress was very friendly and helpfull.
Food was good.
Good Ambiance."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"as usual great service, great vibe, and great homemade food, like the in house msoked bull pork and house BBQ sauce. We had a great time"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,5,5,Best Hard Rock I‚Äôve been to in the world so far üëç. I happened to have a Simple Minds T-shirt on when I arrived and thanks to the manager who went and played a couple of Simple Minds tracks. A very nice touch
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Always a fun place. The live music was great and the music videos were fun without sound actually went with the live music. It was loud but fun. Food great, waitress was the best. Have to say a perfect causal night!!!"

A Paris, c‚Äôest assez petit, tout en longueur, c‚Äôest assez ordinaire.
Bons burgers mais 2 sur 3 etaient tiedes(attente du 3eme sans doute).
Service chaleureux comme dans tous les HRC."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,2,1,We are very disapointed. Too expensive The food was really bad.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,5,2,"Le service √©tait efficace, le serveur sympa. Les Burger sont ce qu'ils sont, rien d'exceptionnel, les frites √©taient bonnes. Mais par contre, hard rock caf√©, on accepte de payer plus cher pour l'ambiance et l√† clairement √† revoir, musique inaudible, qualit√© audio √† revoir, la d√©co une fois qu'on conna√Æt n'impressione plus alors pourquoi revenir??"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,2,5,2,"Apr√®s avoir fait plusieurs hard rock, celui ci est d√©cevant en termes de d√©coration, d‚Äôambiance, de propret√© g√©n√©rale et de qualit√© de la nourriture."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Had a fantastic night courtesy of Eff our server but mainly due to the living legend that is ‚ÄúLiam‚Äù the Assistant Manager. Really enjoyed talking all things Hard Rock and especially about Rita Gillian who we had the pleasure of meeting in Orlando some years ago. Great ambience, friendly team and enjoyed the shot, Sl√°inte"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Customer service was great! 
Really attentive and spoke great English which was such a big help.

Food was lovely, bit overpriced but pay for the experience as well. 
Would visit again :)"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Hard Rock Cafe was an excellent dinner. Hostess Brianda (sp) very welcoming, kind and helpful. Server Rocky fun, nice and took excellent care of us and most of all took my gluten free allergy seriously. Hard Rock Cafe has a gluten free menu in addition to posting gf on its outside posted menu. And this is very hard to find in Paris. They understood my concern about cross contamination and assured me everything would be attended to plus they have a dedicated fryer for gluten free fries. I had a cheeseburger with a gluten free bun and gluten free fries. Not sure that is available anywhere else in Paris! This restaurant should be listed as having a gluten free menu. It was an excellent meal! They have several gluten free options available. All staff were welcoming and friendly!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Diner was very nice, we had the fajitas and the noodle bowl. Service was very friendly"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Sat us down very quickly food and drinks order taken then, very quick to bring us our food , could have slowed down a little between courses... Service was excellent couldn't have ask for better very professional.."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,4,4,"We've been to several Hard Rock caf√©s and the food here was as great as ever. The service was a little slow and it took quite a long time to flag down the waiter to either order more drinks or ask for the bill, but the food arrived reasonably fast. Great ambience for any rock fans and would recommend."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,2,3,"We went there with my teenager. Although we had a resetvation and were seated promptly, we had to wait very long for a waiter and for our food."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,2,2,3,You should only go there if you really need to have the Hard Rock experience. Very noisy and the food is not as good as before. I couldnt chew the meat in our fajitas.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,3,5,4,"Server great. Think name was chatty.Musice tended to go from loud to quiet which was annoying, but other than that fantastic"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,3,4,Arrived on time (1900) and was told to go to the bar as our table wasn‚Äôt ready and that they would inform me when it was. Never got approached by staff or seated so had to find our own table in the bar area to sit and eat. Bar staff were excellent! Disappointed at the shop as I wanted a chrome zippo Hard Rock Cafe lighter to add to my world wide collection and I was told they had SOLD OUT!
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Thank you for the Birthday cake for my wife. It was great.  You are great team.üëç
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,3,3,"Il cameriere ha preso l‚Äôordine in maniera errata quindi due persone su quattro hanno cenato mezz‚Äôora dopo. Il panino era
Veramente modesto. Se deve essere al livello di fast food non potete mettere quei prezzi. Una birra quasi dieci Euro ? Follia . Sono stato in molti hard rock cafe nel modo. Questa √® stata l‚Äôesperienza peggiore √® me ne dispiace."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,We were served by Daniela who was pleasant and attentive

A dreadful place !"

Le repas √©tait tr√®s bon , Burgers, viandes et salades √©taient excellentes"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,3,5,"Big disappointment. Had booked months in advance specifically on a Wednesday for the music. No-one answered the phone Wednesday morning when I rang several times to check live music was still on. When we arrived, no music as the normal person was sick but staff didn't seem to know why ..... They barely knew if music was on or not. They didn't know of it was going to be on another day or not. All staff were lovely but seemed to have not been at all briefed about anything .... When we got our table, reserved months before as we were only in Paris for 3 days, it was round the corner, out of the main action, next to the kitchens, even though Id written in the requests that we were coming for a special even for my son. I had to quiz the waiter to find out more about the rock music items on display and eventually found out about all the pieces on display upstairs ......"

Der gepriesene und auf den Karten abgebildetet neue Messi-Burger entpuppte sich als kleiner Papp-Burger! Eine Riesenentt√§uschung. Die Cola war aus Sirup; die Preise insgesamt unangemessen. Schade!

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,2,"Big fan of the Hard Rock Cafes but this was the worst. Our server only spoke to us to take our order then once we were finished to get the bill, he was no where to be seen. We both ordered the twisted mac and cheese with chicken but when received both our chickens weren‚Äôt cooked properly and were pink, our server was no where and we were hungry so only ate the mac and cheese which was nice as always. The server got our drinks comped due to the problem with the chicken, we did appreciate this, but again we only had a drink each as wasn‚Äôt able to order more."

A patty was missing from my husbands burger, the waiter gave some story about why there was only one patty and said he‚Äôd give a discount.  He did NOT give us any discount.  There was no sanitary precautions and our waiter had no mask on and talking very close to our faces spreading germs onto our table.  When he refilled our drinks, he took the drinks instead of bringing new drinks or refilling them at the table.  Very unprofessional.  Also, stop using ridiculous names on the name tags.  We know our waiters name is not ‚ÄúHOMEBOY‚Äù.  Very disappointing visit to a Hard Rock Cafe."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,Venivamo da Roma arrivati al ristorante ci hanno detto che la prenotazione era annullata perch√© avevano avuto un gruppo di 20 persone per cui la cucina era chiusa e non ci hanno neanche fatto entrare. Avevamo due bambine con noi e ci hanno recato notevole disagio. Tutto questo senza neanche avvertirci
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Rubbish, turned up and were told the kitchen was closed, not even a call to say this even though it had been closed since 5pm, our booking was at 10pm."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"When we arrive they say that don‚Äôt give dinner to us.
It was very very sad thing because we love all of hard rock‚Äôs arround the world and this is the worrst without a dubt.
Don‚Äôt stay at the same level of the others"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Booked both nights of 14th and 15th and not told that the kitchen had problems. Got trains and transport to get there, to be told it was shut and we couldn‚Äôt eat. Had to find somewhere else to eat on Valentine‚Äôs Day in Paris and had no warning. Been to many of these before and had a great time, but this one was very disappointing and won‚Äôt be recommending to anyone or returning."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,The restaurant wasn‚Äòt open.  So we couldn‚Äòt go even though we reserved a table.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,We had a booking for valentines night and we arrived at 20.00. Outside there were some people with big speakers playing loud music. Once we walked in we were told that the kitchen was closed due to this incident. This was with no prior notice. We went the next day and we were told again that the kitchen was closed. This time for no reason.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Nonostante avessimo la prenotazione non ci hanno dato la possibilit√† di cenare dicendo che c‚Äôera stato un problema con le prenotazioni. Cosa non vera in quando il locale era semi vuoto e stavano allestendo la sala per qualche ricorrenza. Ho insistito e pregato di farci accomodare perch√© era il compleanno di mia moglie e con noi presente c‚Äôera nostra figlia di 3 anni, non hanno avuto nessun riguardo in tal senso. In ogni posto in cui ho viaggiato, ho sempre avuto il piacere di recarmi ai vari hard rock caf√®. Dopo questa esperienza non mi vedranno mai pi√π!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Could not even enter the restaurant even with a reservation ""because all the waiters are busy, sorry"" ....
Looks like a huge bus parked in front of the restaurant and filled the place with people. 

THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! 
When the reservation is confirmed we shouldn't be left outside without any explanation. 
Finding a good place at 9:30PM a Sunday night when it's supposed to be a special occasion is impossible! You just ruined a trip to Paris, thanks"

We felt that hard rock was really good value and hope we can manage to visit again in future."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"J'ai pass√© un tr√®s bon moment au bar, en commen√ßant par l'happy hour et sa tortilla , et ensuite buffalo wings et Salade c√©sar.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,2,4,3,"Good nachos. Overall menu has very few options (half the pre-Corona menu). Coktails are decent yet way overpriced, as is food generally."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,5,5,"The reservation was easy and worked. The staff is very kind and makes you feel well and welcome. The service was fast, so that we hadn‚Äôt to wait for a long time.
There were only too many people near us. Nearly no space to move between the tables a we had quite no privacy. 
But these are hard times for all so we understood it. We enjoyed our dinner."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Booked a table for 10:45pm, said they had a ""grace period"" of 20 minutes. Arrived 22:50pm (hard to find a parking spot) they refused to serve us. This is the last time I go there (been there over 20 times since it opened about 30 years ago). Avoid !"

My boyfriend had the steak and everyone could see from miles away that it had a lot of vains and thick pieces of fat that could not be chewed. The steak was not of very good quality and had my boyfriend chewing like a madman, an abomination that they ask 28 euro for it! I had the bacon hamburger. It was great although a bit too raw (I asked √† point but got bleu‚Ä¶). The cocktails were the best that we had during the evening, especially the ones during happy hour!"

Cocktail prices were a little high but overall amazing experience"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"We made a reservation in advance because the restaurant informed us they were serving a traditional Thanksgiving meal on the day of the American holiday. Upping arriving and being seated, we were informed that our reservation wasn‚Äôt sufficient for the meal - there was another, specific reservation that had to be made in order to partake. Nowhere on the website or when we called did anything/anyone say that we needed a different reservation. We even asked our server if there was anything we could do, as that was the only reason we went to a chain restaurant on Thanksgiving and he told us he didn‚Äôt have the authority to do anything. We paid for our drinks and left to find dinner elsewhere."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great service (we came 45 min earlier and were still accepted plus our waitress was awesome).

Ich habe noch nie einen Kellner gehabt, der mir/uns Spitznamen gegeben hat. Seitdem ist meine Frau Princess und ich Ghetto Man. Wenn ihr da hin wollt, fragt nach dem Kellner Homeboy (so nennt er sich wirklich) und gr√º√üt ihn von mir. Ausgezeichneter Service, tolles Essen, freundliches Personal, au√üer im Merchandising.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,4,4,"c‚Äô√©tait super, on a beaucoup aim√© l‚Äôambiance"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,2,4,"I was initially please as my group had arrived early and the Hard Rock team was able to accommodate my party of 4 with the early arrival. That was about the best prt of this visit. The waitress was inattentive and seemed to be somewhere else. She initially left our table without taking all the drink orders. I attempted to get her attention as she appeared to be highly engaged with the bartender. The next time we she came to the table we rushed to put in the entirely of our order (including the drinks previously ignored) for fear of we would not see her again. I ordered the nachos with steak added for my entree and they came out stale as if she didn‚Äôt notify the cooking staff that it was an entree and it sat waiting for the rest of the food from the table to be finished. Lastly, the reservation was made for my wife‚Äôs birthday which I annotated in the reservation and reiterated upon being seated. There was zero acknowledgment. My assumption is that Hard Rock doesn‚Äôt do that any longer. As we were leaving I still left a tip and my wife asked me why I left as much as I did‚Ä¶which essentially confirmed the state of our service during this visit."

La chantilly en bombe sur le brownie √©croul√©e (machine √† chantilly en panne depuis la r√©ouverture!) . Plus de basilic pour le cocktail ,  plus de burger avec les crevettes. 
Une soir√©e a 4 assez catastrophique ‚Ä¶. Que se passe  t il? tr√®s inhabituel du Hard Rock caf√© que je fr√©quente depuis 1991, un accident sans aucun doute."

The cream on the hot fudge brownie had also no taste. And the brownie itself was no good. And my familly was also disapointed.... This is a pitty because we really love HRC."

One bad point was the vegetarian burger: first, there is only 1 vegetarian burger option on the entire menu and it tasted kinda weird in my opinion but that might just be me. 
We had an overal great experience! Thanks!"

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great service. Love the st. Patrick‚Äôs specials. Had a wonderful experience.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We visited the restaurant for lunch and were thoroughly impressed by the quality of the food and the level of service and attentiveness provided by our waiter. Me and my girlfriend both had burgers, one of which was the Moving Mountain vegetarian burger. Which is a must try for vegetarians! It looks like a meat burger but don't worry it isn't! The rock music was loud enough to provide a good ambience that you would expect at Hard Rock, however it was not too loud that you couldn't still have a conversation."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wonderful experience
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,4,4,Our server was quite friendly and personable. Our only issue was at the end of meal getting our check. Other than that it was an enjoyable evening.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,2,3,1,"The restaurant was an embarrassment and should not be allowed to operate whilst being a building site. We booked for 8pm, did not sit down until 8.40pm and there was no explanation. The staff were clearly ran off their feet and the management did not look like they could could cope. The waiting staff admitted the extraction systems in the open kitchen dod not work, which is why the restaurant felt quite smokey. I sat next to a stud wall that was sealed by yellow plastic tape. The toilets were a disgrace covered in toilet paper, no soap and the hand dryer did not work. There was only one toilet open, it had a bucket to catch water from the leaking roof, scaffolding to keep the ceiling up and a hanging strip light, exposed wires and no ceiling tiles. All in all not a great impression for my first time in HRC Paris. We got 2 free drinks to say sorry, but with little memorabilia, a poor atmosphere and nearly 20 euros per dish I was incredibly disappointed."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Perfect birthday dinner!

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,4,2,The atmosphere was not as good as most other hard rock cafes.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,2,2,5,"It all started so well, we got drinks and our starter quite quickly and it was lovely.

However, thats where it went downhill for my wife.

She received her main meal and began eating it only to be faced with a long gray hair in her burger that had greens attached to it.

We raised this with the waiter who appeared to want to do nothing with it. My wife felt sick after this and didnt want to eat her burger, so I swapped with her.

At the end of the meal we raised it again not wanting to kick off to see if they would offer anything as an apology, which they didnt.

So we paid and left unhappily.

I didnt want to make a fuss, which I now should have, as I expected at the least, a new meal for my wife brought to the table or a discounted meal, we got neither.

I personally would have walked out and not paid a penny to be honest, but my wife didnt want the fuss."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,2,3,Always love Hard Rock Cafe but this one is the least favourite the service was very slow and the waiter we had wasnt very friendly

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,5,5,"This Hard Rock never disappoints! We are from the U.S. and go whenever we travel to Paris every few years. Service was top notch with ‚ÄúHomeboy‚Äù; he is one of the best servers ever! He always makes us feel special like we are old friends. Food quality is very good, the best of all the many of the other Hard Rock cafes we have been to."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,3,4,"Super accueil, notre serveur au top, r√©servation respect√©e (table demand√©e dans 1 coin et √† l'√©tage), super cocktail.
Par contre, 3 plats sont arriv√©s √† peine chaud et le mien j'ai d√ª le r√©clamer car oubli en cuisine donc je n'ai pas pu manger en m√™me temps que ma famille et mon plat est arriv√© √† peine chaud aussi. Les plats tr√®s ti√®des au prix vendu c'est abus√©.
Sinon, le reste √©tait bien"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,3,4,4,"Lieu mythique incontournable pour les habitu√©s aux Hard Rock caf√©s.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,5,5,The gold burger was wonderful. The process for getting seated was flawed with no place to wait. Waiter was great.

Never happened in other Hard Rock in other countries."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,1,4,3,The meet of the burger was very bad quality and was smelling!
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,Very kind and helpful staff at the reception. Waiters only for food and not drinks. Self-service is for cheap bars only. Barman's behavior when producing drinks was like degraded bars. High prices. Good music.

R√©servation effectu√©e et attente de 1h15 avant de s'assoir et 30 minutes pour avoir la carte. Serveuse tr√®s agressive, pas du tout aimable. Plats en rupture. 
Des tables en vrac une vrai cacophonie, comme une cantine.
Les plats n'√©taient pas √† la hauteur en comparaison d'autres Hard Rock US... Une ambiance caf√©t√©ria qui g√¢che l'enseigne."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,5,4,We hadden gereserveerd om 18:30. We kregen te horen dat we 10 minuten moesten wachten omdat de tafel schoon gemaakt moest worden. Na 45 minuten te hebben gewacht was m‚Äôn geduld op en ben ik ge√Ørriteerd naar degene gestapt die de reserveringen regelt. Binnen een minuut kregen we een tafel op de 1e verdieping waarvan de helft nog niet gevuld was. En dat terwijl er heel veel mensen aan het wachten waren. We hebben voor de rest een hele leuke avond gehad en lekker gegeten. De aanvang was wel een smetje!
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,2,1,3,"We had a booking but had to wait for 40 minutes... Staff wasn't really experienced but nice so I can't  complain, being in Pairs :-)
About the food. It is big and good-ish, but not cheap at all. Doesn't worth it."

There were two managers who even came by to our table to chat with us, especially the flashy smartly dressed ‚ÄúBoniface‚Äù. 

You guys rock. Thank you."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,4,2,"The food seemed to be microwaved when it arrived, for what we paid the food wasn‚Äôt up to the standard, just very poor quality of food, however the service was very good and obliging"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,We arrived with 15 minutes of delay and out table was not available anymore. We waited 45 minutes to get a new table outside but after 45 minutes of waiting it was still not available so we left without having dinner that evening.

Music programm very bad, dont you Forget Your Name?? ROCK 
burger expansive and normal .
4 tourists.....
It was the 3rd Time in paris"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,3,It‚Äôs a regular hard rock but the prices are pretty steep for this type of restaurant and I wasn‚Äôt expecting that. The food wasn‚Äôt bad but I wouldn‚Äôt make a personal suggestion to make this a must go to. If you‚Äôre in the mood for your typical American dinner then go but look forward to spending some extra cash to do that.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,5,5,"Great meal and  good service only downside is you are paying over 9 euros for a pint of beer, you would not even pay that price in the centre of London"

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,2,5,"I always visit. hard rock cafe when I travel to new places. This place had better music memorabilia compared to some other places. However, I won‚Äôt be visiting this place again. Service was slow and our meals were luke warm. When we were re issued with new meals, my meal was hot but my wife‚Äôs burger was nearly raw, when it was supposed to be medium. Disappointed, HRC‚Äôs are so expensive so you would expect a much better service"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,2,3,"Food was good and came out quick, however we Waited over half an hour for a dessert menu to be brought to the table (it wasn‚Äôt very busy) and asked at least twice for it, the waitress then came over a third time without the menu and asked if we would like the bill, so at this point we decided we would
Go elsewhere."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,3,3,"Went to Hard Rock Cafe Amsterdam earlier this year and the Paris one doesn‚Äôt come close to compare. Firstly the prices were ridiculously high, especially considering it was half the price just across the pond in Amsterdam. We were in time for happy hour and they said they couldn‚Äôt give it to us because the till wasn‚Äôt working and so it was ‚Ç¨28 for 2 drinks but next door was only ‚Ç¨11 for two!! Not to mention just to get some water it wasn‚Äôt free like Amsterdam but was an outrageous ‚Ç¨7, it‚Äôs not even a special drink. Food was ok but a bit basic for the price (which was again ridiculous amount- the starters were the same price as the mains!)  and didn‚Äôt compare in portion or presentation to Amsterdam. Had the mac& cheese and it was something a kid could get in a cheap restaurant with pepper in which was really weird. It was also the cheapest thing on the menu at a staggering ‚Ç¨17. The menu also was half the size of Amsterdam and so was really underwhelming with only about 10 items on it, compared to pages and pages at Amsterdam, it was mainly a few burgers and a few other meat dishes  :( . The waiters were helpful but in a hurry to get you out of the restaurant when it wasn‚Äôt busy at all and were speaking super loud to other tables so we could hear every conversation which wasn‚Äôt needed. Felt a bit let down considering how good the Amsterdam restaurant was compared to this one."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Celebrated my sons 11th birthday at Paris Hard Rock and it was a night he will never forget. He absolutely loved. Thanks again Hard Rock.

An overall great experience and would go back in the future!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,3,"All good, the tables were a bit close together."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,3,5,4,"We went to Hard Rock Caf√© Paris on Saturday 2 November. The hostess was nice and asked us if we were all above 18 years old, as we were with 4 young adults. After we got our table we had a very nice and fun waiter who let us laugh a lot and helped us trough the difficulty of choosing :) 
The only thing that we thought was a problem, was that there was a big group of people for an American themed party that thought that the waiters where their slaves. The lack of respect that they showed to the waiters was terrible. If it was my restaurant and people came in like that I will trow them out right away, especially because they made such a problem that the waiters needed to ask other tables to reseat them somewhere else. 
Either way thumbs up for the friendliness and making us laugh a lot!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,2,3,4,Toutes nos viandes √©taient froides (pas ti√®de). A revoir...

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,5,4,"Tr√®s bonne ambiance en cette soir√©e d'Halloween, accueil et service √† la hauteur de l'√©v√©nement. Nourriture excellente et copieuse. Les d√©guisements et maquillages √©taient sublimes tant du c√¥t√© des clients que du c√¥t√© du personnel. Excellente musique, mais volume vraiment trop fort : impossible de converser normalement avec ses voisins de table, c'est le seul point √† am√©liorer, mais nous √©tions l√† d'abord pour l'ambiance et la musiqueü§ò !"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,1,4,5,"Very nice decoration for Halloween. Most waiters dressed up unfortunately not ours. Food took forevers to be served and arrived half burned, half cold. We left most of it untouched. First time this happens in a Hard Rock caf√©."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Everything was very well, nice personal. The Burgers are good, but a little bit expensive, but ok it's the Hard Rock... Reservation was easy and correct."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Me and my partner booked a table for 9pm as a birthday meal and when we were greeted, we had to wait for our table, even though we had booked.

We were taken to our seat and our drinks were ordered. Along came our waiter 5 minutes after and we proceeded to order the shrimps for starter and a burger and open sandwich for our mains.

We were sat directly opposite the grill area and watched meals be sat around for 10 minutes as no one was taking these to the tables.

Our starter was sat on the side for 10 minutes under no heated lighting until it was eventually brought over to us. 

Once we had finished our starters, no one came over to take away our plates or offer us anymore drinks, as ours were empty.

In the middle of waiting for our mains our waiter David came over and apologised that he had disappeared, advising that on one of his tables a note had been left saying ‚Äòhelp me‚Äô so he had to investigate this.

After a half an hour wait and our meals sitting around for a further 5 minutes they brought over to us. We were not asked if we wanted any extra drinks or sauces so we had to ask a waiter separately for this.

My partners open sandwich was Luke warm and after our waiter coming over 15 minutes after, once my meal had been finished, he offered a new meal, however my partner declined as he would then be eating on his own.

At the end of our meal my partner went to see a manager and asked for our bill to be revised as we were not happy with the service or the food.

After only taking the one meal off, my partner went to speak to the manager again, who started laughing at my partner and speaking in french to his colleague who again kept laughing and smirking. The manager was extremely rude and kept arguing with my partner. Our waiter also denied coming over to us regarding the note, and lied infront of us.

We have been to several Hard rock cafes and this has ruined our whole experience and we would endeavour to never come back."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"The food was cool,  but the place was wery noisy!!"

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,5,4,"Our server was absolutely fantastic! Her English was really good. I was convinced she was from the US, but turns out Brazil! 

The food is the traditional Hard Rock menu and didn‚Äôt disappoint. Of course, everything was slightly different given the European twist, but my sons got their chicken wings and ketchup for their fries so all was well. 

Would recommend for anyone wanting a bit of American food (and great music) while in Paris."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,4,Service was fantastic as we were served by Christine (if I remember correctly) who dealt with our table while also dealing with two separate tables which had complaints.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,5,5,"The service was friendly and very fast. The atmosphere in every Hard Rock Cafe is super pleasant. The only pity was that there is not a big choice of dishes without meat. The food was still great, I am looking forward to the next time."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"It was a great experience at the Hard Rock Cafe. Besides the fact that we were 15 mins late, because of traffic, I got a small eye roll but was still quickly seated. Waiter was amazing, food cake so quickly, which was amazing for my hungry children. Drinks came quickly and everyone was happy. Portions were very big, so we ordered appetizers and then didn‚Äôt have room for any more food. Reasonably priced. Wish we would have ordered Uber 15 mins before we were ready to go, because it‚Äôs a very busy location. All in all very good. Kids food came in a cool plastic guitar plate! They loved it"

We were never got offered any condiments we had to help ourselves of another table, I also had to got to the bar to ask to order drinks for our table, I have been to a few Hard Rock Cafes around the world and the experience here was very bad.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,1,2,"We went for my friends birthday and was very disappointed!! She had to wait ages for her order as waitress got it wrong and I am vegan and I was told that they could make the vegetarian burger vegan by my waitress so I ordered it . Then when I came there was mayonnaise on it and it was in a brioche bun so eggs and butter !! So not only was there nothing on the menu for vegans but the waitress lied to me !! This is 2019 and there are such a lot of vegans now just can‚Äôt believe they are not catering for us !! Also why they couldn‚Äôt even put something together for me I don‚Äôt know ! 
The waitress was very rude and didn‚Äôt check on us once our food had come ! So I asked to see a manager who took the meals off the bill and gave my son a T-shirt and plate so he was happy 
We left happy that we didn‚Äôt have to pay and we‚Äôre compensated !! 
But come on Hard Rock get a good vegan dish on the menu !!"

Unfortunately, she left half was through, and that was when our visit went extremely downhill. Waited a long time for a drink we had ordered, and received a large without asking for it but was made to pay for it, after questioning this on the bill. Extremely unprofessional how we were treated and we were made to feel stupid and were belittled. Will not be returning."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,4,3,"Food is good although the new menu has removed some legendary recipes such as Texan, and Pulled pork is not as good as  before. Steak salad si good ; Waiter was great has usual  It becomes now very expensive for a meal. Furthermore the cheesecake is no more made on premises but frozen."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,5,3,"After a long day of sightseeing in Paris, Hard Rock was a little taste of home.  Our waitress, Lola, was a breath of fresh air.  She was very friendly and attentive.  The service was great and the food was good."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,2,5,3,"To expensive for food not on the top.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,4,4,Trouv√© morceaux de plastique dans 2 steaks.  Cela ressemblait √† du filet en plastique incrust√© dans la viande.  Le responsable avait un sourire ironique lorsqu'on lui a  expliqu√©. Il a de suite emport√© le morceau de plastique.  Comme une grande faveur de sa part il a d√©duit un plat de la facture.  Le serveur √©tait d√©sol√© pour nous.  Quand √† nous qui n'avons rien trouv√© dans nos plats on se demande encore si on a pas mang√© aussi  du plastique...
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,5,"La nourriture est bonne et le service tr√®s agr√©able. Kathy est au petit soin pour nous. En revanche nous √©tions venus sp√©cialement pour la semaine Freddy Mercury et aucune animation n'√©tait pr√©ve sur le week end contrairement √† ce qui est √©crit sur internet et devant le restaurant. Les enfants, fans de Freddy et de Queen, ont √©t√© d√©√ßus. Dommage."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,4,4,"We wanted a rock atmosphere, unfortunately we had a Pop atmosphere. We could hear more customer noise than music. The souvenir glasses promised in the menu were not available.
Too expensive for what it is."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,4,"We ordered 2 New York Strip Steak. we asked medium for both and they brought us one well done steak and one almost well done steak. when my spouse called the waiter  and told me him about the incident instead of saying sorry he asked me if maybe I want to eat the well done and give my spouse my steak, which was a little bit less well done total grey steak. this is not how you should treat your customers.
he took my spouse steak and we waited to the new steak to arrive, we told to make sure this time it will come medium and also told as a safety to tell the kitchen to make it medium-rare. guess what - we got 1/5 part of medium steak and 4/5 of  well-done steak.
also, the mash potato was full of potato skin and we didn't enjoy this as well.
Finally, we waited like 10 minutes for the bill and when we asked from some other waiters the bill they just told us to wait until our waiter will arrive, very bad service
this is such a shame because when we ate in Prague, Czech, everything was great.
I‚Äôm never going to eat in hard rock again."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,4,5,"Endroit sympa, repas et boissons copieux et tr√®s bon."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,4,We were just a little disappointed with the amount of the memorabilia on display. C'mon... it's the Hard Rock of Paris! We expected something more. Very kind service and nice food.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,A very nice place for anyone who loves rock music and excellent food.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,2,3,5,"Unfortunately my potato chips were luke warm upon arrival to the table, our server was pleasant but overall food could have improved"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,Great staff & a good location! Ideal for birthday celebrations!
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,5,3,"The food was cold and not so tasty

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Lovely lunch here, good lively vibe, tasty food and generous portions. Noemi was our waitress and she is a real asset, professional, friendly and efficient. We ate chicken Caesar salad, nachos and mashed potato and drank a chocolate cookie milkshake and a pi√±a colada. Portions are huge and the food is always of a high standard, we love it here."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Au top merci beaucoup
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Wonderful food and service, will visit again and recommend to those visiting paris"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,2,3,4,"No destaca por su ubicaci√≥n. Podr√≠a estar m√°s cerca de alg√∫n lugar relevante.

El personal es muy agradable y amable, pero pensamos que har√≠a falta contratar m√°s, porque tardaban demasiado en traer los pedidos, tanto platos principales como postres.

El local es bastante grande. Lo mejor es la ambientaci√≥n interior, con el gran panel ""Hard Rock Par√≠s"" y el atrezzo t√≠pico de este tipo de locales, lleno de guitarras y otros efectos de miembros famosos del mundo del rock. Tambi√©n much√≠simas pantallas con v√≠deos musicales, que dan ese toque especial al ambiente.

Lo peor del local es la comida, muy descuidada. No es que est√© mala, pero se nota poco cuidado al hacerla, con un beicon muy pasado, por ejemplo. La legendary burger, que es uno de los platos que siempre pedimos, est√° muy lejos en sabor y aspecto que en otros locales de la marca, y las patatas fritas que la acompa√±an tambi√©n muy descuidadas. Como postre pedimos la copa grande de brownie con helado, y ten√≠a much√≠sima nata montada (casi toda la copa) y poco de lo dem√°s.

En resumen, mucho tiene que mejorar para ponerse al nivel de los otros que hemos visitado."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,5,4,"Can‚Äôt fault the service; attentive, happy and engaging, but the food especially the chicken fajitas (dry and reheated?) was really poor. At ‚Ç¨150 for family of 4 with a couple of alcoholic drinks and no starters, it was over priced in our opinion."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Little bit expensive for what it is, but the ambiance, and the waiters are amazing !"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,5,3,4,"Essen ist gut und reichlich. Service sehr freundlich. 
Leider wurde bei beiden Besuchen nie der Happyhour - Preis ber√ºcksichtigt. Das h√§tte ca 15 Euro ausgemacht.
Das musste man einfordern. Au√üerdem scheint es beabsichtigt zu sein."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,3,3,"As always the food is great and the overall experiance is nice and comfortable. 
The amount of beers was a bit shy though (and overpriced) but I guess that is the way they roll in most restaurants in Paris!
Anyway, a great place in general!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,3,3,1,"Llegamos a las 21:00 con reserva previa, nos atendieron bien y r√°pido, al principio. A las 9:30 ya ten√≠amos el entrante, pero luego tardaron m√°s de 45 minutos en traer las hamburguesas. 3 ven√≠an bien, una con la carne quemada y otra pasada de punto. Salimos del restaurante casi a las 23:30.
Too slow attention. After a previous booking, we arrived at 21:00 and went out at 23:30, after first plate we waited more than 45 minutes for hamburgues. 3 meets were good but 1 was burned and another out of point requested.  Waiter attention was good, the only good point."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"I visited many Hard rock cafe all over the world, but for first time i saw something like a restaurant...
I was so surprised.
I expected a bar for drinks only and hard rock music"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Lovely! We missed American food especially in France as it is not easy to find one that's authentic and tasty. We ordered the nachos and buffalo wings sitting close to the bar. Service a little slow but overall is good.

Asked for burgers well done, 2 were rare. Got 2 new burgers with compensation free drinks. Overall good but service can be a lot better."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,4,1,1,it was my girlfriend's birthday and only at the entrance could congratulations get rid of it. I am not used to this from Hard Rock Cafe or any other restaurant.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Everything was good. Arrived early and seated fine. Service good and food good
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,2,1,4,"Waiters were rude. Didn‚Äôt help out with questions we had.
Although I had reserved a table they made us stand for over 10 minutes and there wasn‚Äôt place at the bar to sit. 
The menu changed, there were more options before, also the burgers became very plain tasting. Nothing special about the food anymore."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,3,5,"They made us wait at the reception while an employee conducts to our table. Although we had a reservation, the employee who told us this was still there, but he still led the other guests to their table. A non-alcoholic cocktail was ordered, but the waiter brought an alcoholic one. After explaining that we need a non-alcoholic cocktail, the waiter changed it. However, the food and atmosphere impressed and left a positive impression of the cafe and the desire to return there in the future."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,2,5,Unfortunatly pur waitress forgot our free Cocktails and our french fries

Autant dire que pour souhaiter un joyeux anniversaire √† mon fils nous avons eu une ambiance super au grand d√©sespoir de mon fils qui est assez timide et qui f√™tait ses 16 ans !!!!!!
La nourriture √©tait excellente et malgr√© la quantit√© nous avons tout mang√© !!!

Natacha"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Our server was excellent! Very happy and polite and made us feel at ease and well looked after throughout. The food was fantastic! Personally think it‚Äôs good value for money, the portions are really good for the price and I love the fact that paying a little extra meant I got a souvenir glass to take home for half the price it would normally be. Perfect atmosphere, fab music just my style.
I booked this for my best friends birthday and it definitely did not disappoint!"

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We were in Paris 7 nights and ate at the Hard Rock Cafe 3 times.  My daughter has multiple food allergies and cross contact is a concern.

Thank you very much."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,3,3,"Si vous avez l'envie de manger un hamburger bien garni, vous √™tes √† la bonne adresse. 
Par contre, si vous souhaitez manger √† l'aise dans une ambiance calme et peu bruyante, passez votre chemin. 
En effet, quel que soit le Hard Rock Caf√© o√π vous vous rendrez, l'impression est qu'√† peine assis, le seul souhait est de vous voir repartir. Rentabilit√© quand tu nous tiens... 
Quant au fond sonore musical, il pourrait √™tre d'un volume inf√©rieur afin de faciliter l'√©change entre les convives. 
Rentabilit√© & bruit sont donc deux √©l√©ments avec lesquels il faut composer si l'on a le souhait de manger un de leur l√©gendaire hamburger !"

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent food and service.  There was a small hiccup with our older as two of us had vouchers and 4 didnt and the food did not come out together but the manager was so apologetic and offered us free tshirts for the trouble.  We didnt complain, the issue never even got to that point as the manager was on top of it being proactive.  I would advise everyone to eat there.  They really know how to make you feel welcome and that you actually matter as a customer!!!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,4,"The sound in the background is a bit loud (we have to talk loudly to understand each other and it's a bit annoying), otherwise, everything was perfect !

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,3,4,"I wouldn't necessarily go there again so unless you are a real HRC addict there are better places around...Service was somewhat ok, friendly, but not very attentive, food wasn't bad but could have been hotter. Very loud even outside. Value for money was ok."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,2,1,5,"Worst hard rock yet!
Our Server was either drunk, drugged or overtired - she was sent home before taking our food order (after taking ages to fetch our drinks p) 
No ribs available.
Very boring, mediocre side salad. (5 or 6 years ago I had the best side salad ever) 
On the plus side my friend loved her spicy prawns, and the music was great as always!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,2,3,"Bons burgers et portions g√©n√©reuses. Super animation pour enfants le dimanche. 
Mais musique beaucoup trop forte et service extr√™mement lent et long. 
C‚Äô√©tait aussi tr√®s long de trouver une table car nous avions un b√©b√© dans une poussette. 
Il faut vraiment avoir plus de serveurs pour les jours de rush et surtout baisser le niveau sonore car c‚Äôest quasiment insupportable"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Super
Nous avons appr√©ci√© le cadre,l ambiance et le repas.
Nous reviendrons prochainement"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Really good service, excellent food. Just didn‚Äôt realise how big the portions were. We loved the choice in music too. The waitress ensured we were always ok with food and drink. Definitely would go again if we were in Paris"

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,5,4,"Noise was too loud.
√Ä part la musique trop forte qui √©tait g√™nante pour discuter, le reste √©tait tr√®s bien."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Ich kam als Gast mit meiner Frau und war im Ganzen sehr zufrieden.
Wir sind sehr freundlich bedient worden und mussten viel lachen mit der Bedienung. 
Das Essen kam z√ºgig aber nicht zu schnell zwischen Vorspeise , Hauptgang und Nachspeise.
Alles war sehr toll angerichtet und sehr lecker.
Das Einzige, was mich gest√∂rt hatte war die laute Musik, die es schwer machte sich zu unterhalten.

In Allem ein gelungener Abend."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,5,4,4,"Booked a table 2 weeks in advance. When we arrived we were told we'd have to wait 30 minutes despite having a reservation. Ultimately we waited 90 minutes only to be told we'd have to eat at the bar.

What is the point in having a reservation service, if tables aren't kept open for the customers. There were many others who were in the same situation.

I understand that the Hard Rock Cafe is busy either way, but don't offer service you can't provide."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,1,3,"We were dissapointed about the service because the waiter first put our food on the wrong table next to us. They already started to eat from the food, a few minutes later the waiter realized that he made a mistake and he took away the plates. Then he brought the same plates to our table."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,4,4,"Sadly, the medium-rare ordered steak was not at this point and also the offered substitution was medium instead the now ordered rare condition."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,5,3,Nice food and service.tables far too close together. Had to sit side by side with companion as i couldnt fit into the back of the table as the next table was  too close.  Too many tables in too small a place.

Authentic JUMBO COMBO should return : potatoe skins, 3 kinds of saucage,...
Excellent choice of cocktails as usual with frequent updates. There's just 1 problem : the price. Normal size is indecent (too much ice) and large size is a theft (even with so much ice).
Music really nice with a special mention for METALLICA (the day they play in Paris)"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,3,1,"Waiting queue is very long

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,3,"I find the burgers quality a bit fluctuating especially for the meat. 
The side I was given (home made fries with Parmesan) was not what expected. More emmental than Parmesan. 
The burgers should come with a side of coleslaw or a pickle. 
The menu is the same as always some ¬´¬†nouveaut√©s¬†¬ª would be much appreciated."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,2,2,3,"Poor service,  no attendance to the guest. Baby pork ribs were served quite cold....Steak was dry and tasteless. Longtime waiting for the food and our main dishes were not served the same time. A shame for the Hard Rock Cafe. Meanwhile we had recently nice dinners at the Hard Rock Cafe in Amsterdam and Prague."

expensive for the very poor quality it is"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"We enjoyed our meal at Hard Rock Cafe in Paris. Food was timely and the staff was very upbeat and friendly. The only thing I have to say is that when you have a message written all over you menu about ‚Äúkeep sipping we‚Äôll do the shipping‚Äù meaning you will ship goods that people purchase, then up sell the drinks so we have two glasses to try to get home. We go to the store and they have no idea what we‚Äôre talking about. Your pricing is really high anyhow especially for drinks, but we had figured the glasses could be shipped. But you might consider removing your advertising for the shipping if you aren‚Äôt going to offer this within your store as people who are traveling might think they have this option. Other than that great place. Please look at having more variety of shirts for each location that is unique to that area. Thanks"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,4,4,"but not so nearly of the kitchen
we smell french fries all the afternoon"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,3,1,4,"Poor customer service. 
Eating our starters when the main arrived. Had to send them back and they served us the same one later whic were cold so had to send them back. Charged us two mains as they had to remake them. 
Rude waitress who assumed we couldn‚Äôt understand French but she got it wrong."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,3,1,4,"Not good.  Staff seemed put off to serve us.  Worst of all they played and showed the video, pass the dutchie.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,2,3,"Noisy: Very noisy music voice. Incompatible with eating. Impossible to relax and enjoy a dinner.

Service: Many times asked to reduce the audio speakers volume. Two times asked ""medium well"" steak, but waiter didn't listen to me and all the time was in a harry. There was no Tobasco."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,2,2,5,"Den Vegiburger gabs nicht mehr, nur noch einen mit Quinoa. War nicht so super. Der andere Burger den wir bestellt haben, kam der Kellner mit meinem fertigen Essen an den Tisch um zu sagen, dass sie das Fleisch f√ºr den bestellten Burger nicht mehr vorr√§tig h√§tten. Na ja von fr√ºheren Besuchen in verschiedenen Hard Rock Cafes sind wir anderes gewohnt. Aber Atmosph√§re war sch√∂n."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Outstanding restaurant, food was amazing and such good value. Our waiter was so lovely, bubbly and made us feel so welcome.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,5,3,"Had hot wings the sauce was hot the chicken wasn't. The mains had creamy mash - it was freezing cold had to get a separate mash spoiled the mains. Also seasonable veg is just three pieces of hard broccoli - why not just say broccoli?! surely broccoli is in season all year?! Thought it might be a nice mixture of veg. 
The service was impeccable the waiter was great. More attention to the food it couldve been amazing - its not like they were mad busy there was more people in the merch shop lol"

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Le service a √©t√© parfait, rapide et les plats d√©licieux. Pour l'anniversaire surprise de mon enfant, les conseils qui m'ont √©t√© donn√© √† mon arriv√© ont √©t√© parfait pour que ce moment lui laisse des √©toiles dans les yeux."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,5,3,very friendly waitress. Fast service. Good atmosphere
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Fun spot. Very easy to find (just out of the subway station). We shared nachos with the Teen then had burgers...very tasty. The dessert menu is a bit poor, but we were full so it didn't matter. Our server Agneszka was really nice."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"It's always a pleasure to come and eat at the Hard Rock Caf√© in Paris.
Food and music at the top."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Had a fab meal and cocktails, thoroughly embarrassed our friend by getting the whole restaurant to sing happy birthday too her!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,3,3,"Il serait de bon aloi de penser √† faire des plats sans lactose ni traces de laits.
Car nous avons d√ª n√©gocier pour avoir une carte des allerg√®nes qui n‚Äô√©tait m√™me pas compl√®te, c‚Äôest plut√¥t aga√ßant.

Heureusement que le serveur et le responsable se sont montr√©s compr√©hensifs et inventifs pour proposer un plat √† ma compagne. Je remercie d‚Äôailleurs le chef d‚Äôavoir suivi nos recommandations pour la pr√©paration du plat.
Ma compagne ayant une allergie mortelle au lait et d√©riv√©s (m√™me aux traces de lait), ils ont su nous rassurer."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,4,5,Service was quick and our waiter was polite and helpful. The food was delicious and the drinks good.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Recommend making reservations as it gets super busy. Food and drinks were pretty good, up to standards for Hard Rock. Customer service was excellent, very accomodating."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Booked the table for 19/01/19 for a 21st birthday celebration. It‚Äôs started off great. Got sat quick and had our drinks. Once ordering the food it started to go down hill. Firstly not being told some of the items had ran out on the menu. And then once the food was order there was a really long wait until we had our food. It‚Äôs finally came out but only 5 out of the six meals turned up, 3 of them meals were stone cold, and had to be sent back but instead of them cooking fresh they had the cheek to stick it in the microwave so them meals were very poor quality, finally about 15minutes after everyone else having there food the final meal turned up and that was also cold. For most of the night the waiter was no where to be seen. I‚Äôve been to many of the hard rock restaurants and always had a good meal. But this time it was horrible worst meal in a very long time and to top it off it spoilt a birthday celebration."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,4,3,"Compared to other Hard Rock Cafes, this seemed extremely expensive! Almost ‚Ç¨18 for a cocktail! Waiter was very good though."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"As usual we had a great time at Hard Rock Caf√©. 
Just one little thing : we saw a small mouse running on the floor. It disapeared quickly but...
I know there are a lot of mice currently in Paris so I don't really mind but some customers may be shocked."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,2,3,2,Overpriced. Burger was greasy and Luke warm.  Wouldn‚Äôt recommend
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,3,3,2 guests in the party ordered a chicken sandwich which arrived stone cold and was hard to swallow. Definitely would not recommend.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,5,5,"Table r√©serv√©e √† 18h30 pour 20h30 pour 3 personnes.
On a juste eu √† attendre 2-3 minutes le temps que la table soit pr√™te.

Beaucoup de clients (victime de son succ√®s), mais beaucoup de serveurs aussi donc le temps d'attente est correct.
Les plats sont bons et m√™me si leurs prix peuvent para√Ætre chers, la quantit√© servie est proportionnelle.
Le cadre est agr√©able et, fan de rock oblige, les guitares et autres objets expos√©s dans l'√©tablissement vous font sourire et rappeler des bon moments de musique."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Piatto di antipasti misti ottimo! Da ripetere!
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,5,5,Our server was amazing really enjoyed this HRC and food was nice and tasty. We paid for it though. Very expensive
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,4,3,We had a positive experience at Hard Rock.  Our server was attentive and wanted us to enjoy our meal experience.  He was able to answer questions about menu items and make suggestions.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,4,4,Good food with a good atmosphere and music.  Wait staff was friendly and prompt.  Overall a good time and value.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,4,3,"Bonne exp√©rience. Juste un b√©mol : plac√©s pr√®s de l‚Äôentr√©e, nous avons √©t√© g√™n√©s par des courants d‚Äôair frais malgr√© le rideau install√©."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,3,4,"The food and service were really good, the waiter was friendly and helpful. However, the ladies bathroom was kind of dirty and no toilet paper at all. I think that such a nice place like Hard Rock Cafe should have a clean bathroom with toilet paper available, someone should check the ladies bathroom condition."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,2,2,4,"We reserved a table here to get some cauliflower wings for our last night in Paris. The waiter, who was friendly and spoke good english, took our order of a nacho plate, the wings and drinks without any problems. However, when we were almost finished with the starters, he came to tell us that they were out of the cauliflower wings and told us to pick something else, without apologizing. We are vegetarians and there is really not much to choose from - so we only had some dessert and left. This was a dissapointment for us, especially when the bill came out to be 70‚Ç¨ for a starter and two drinks and small desserts and we didn‚Äôt even get what we came for."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,2,3,"Food was lovely, service was slow, a salt shaker was knocked from a table on the balcony and shattered on our table and around our feet & belongings. Staff weren‚Äôt very attentive and we had to ask them to clean up which was quite disappointing."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,3,Anniversaire. Service horrible. Nourriture froide. Prix exorbitant
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,4,1,3,"I had a reservation for 21.00, was there already one hour earlier. I noted on the reservation as theme a date. But I has tonwait until 21.20 no seating there. I asked then a guy why I habe to wait and new guys will be seated. Then the guy gave us a seat but nothing to do wirh a reservation.

Verry uncomfortable.. If you not reserve the waiting time was 2 hours"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,2,3,"Despite having a reservation we waited a full 50 minutes. We were told to wait upstairs at the bar. Waiter upstairs ran around ignoring us. After ~20 minutes we friendly inquired about seating us, when he asked us to give him 5 minutes. He did not get back to us. Another half hour later we  found a table in the bar area and ordered at the bar. This was certainly not our best HRC experience."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,4,2,Booked for 7.30 on trip to Paris. Arrived early to be told we could be seated early. Seated 20 minutes late. Couldn‚Äôt move as tables crammed In. Food took two hours yes two hours to come. Pregnant girlfriends burger was raw so sent back. Second one arrives still Red! Sent back and left totally. There were too many people booked in and staff said kitchen couldn‚Äôt cope. Just avoid
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,3,3,Attente de 45 minutes malgr√© une r√©servation - ce n‚Äôest simplement pas correct. Oubli des entr√©es dans la commande.

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,1,5,2,"Was placed on a table near the door and had to request to move due to how cold it was. Second table was no warmer and consequently food went cold very fast. However our waiter was lovely and gave very good service, the only highlight of our experience."

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,3,4,"The steak is thick and juicy. We ordered the Mac n cheese with bacon it is delicious as well. 
We had to repeat our order 3-4 times before the service staff get it right. We have ordered the red wine but the staff give us the wrong bottle. 
Overall, good experience!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,5,5,Trop froid !!!! Il faut absolument qu‚Äôil trouve un syst√®me pour couper le froid. Passer 2 h √† manger avec le courant d‚Äôair aux jambes alors qu‚Äôil fait 0 dehors et payer le m√™me prix c‚Äôest abus√©. Rien √† dire sur le service impeccable comme d‚Äôhabitude
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,3,5,5,"I ended up only having a drink, but I'm a frequent customer and i love the place."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,1,4,5,"It was Christmas Day, date for two. We ordered two dishes, a burger and the New York steak. The burger was tasteful, the steak though was awful. The steak was very harsh to chew and I didn‚Äôt eat it after all. A plus was the mushed potatoes!!"

Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,1,4,Bad exepereince with All the staff!!!!! Never Again in paris !
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,3,1,It was a real disappointment. Like a glorified MacDonalds except the smell of grease even worse. The food was awful and over priced. I was expecting the place to live up to its reputation and especially being in Paris thought it would be extra. Food is canteen no care food. Person who sat us was gruff and not welcoming. Our waitress was nice. Water comes in old scratched glasses looking dirty. NO AMBIENCE. NO AMBIENCE. NO AMBIENCE. A real shame. Will never go back.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,2,1,1,"For the first time I was very disappointed in the chain restaurant because the bad servic and attitude of the negative manager ,JOSEF, who didn‚Äôt try to help and talk to us rudely.  So this the last time I will visit you"

The bar is excellent and again great friendly staff and excellent choice of drinks. Can‚Äôt wait to return"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,3,5,3,Very Nice atmosphere. The Wainwright was Nice and polite and gave US recomandation where to go in Paris
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,4,4,"Second time for a business team meal, not perfect but we had a god time. Last time 
we were offered a Hard Rock glass as a gift for the hudge bill, but not the second time..."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,2,4,3,"Was ok as a special visit but I wouldn‚Äôt go back very expensive for what it is, noisy 
Staff were lovely though"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,5,5,Food was great barring desserts
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"We were disgusted with the food, as I am allergic to mayonnaise and twice they brought my sandwich back with mayonnaise on it"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,1,3,3,"Unfortunately a burger was sent back twice for being cold and excessively greasy, it was dripping. The manager was really apologetic. We use Hard Rock a lot and have used Paris before with no problem."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,serive with a smile! food was great and exactly how my boyfriend and I requested it (we had the steak) and it was served so quickly!
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"we spent a very nice sunday evening in the restaurant. We came from Haute-Savoie and it was the first time we tested HARD ROCK cafe.
We will remember this dinner, even music was good.
Thanks to all the team.
I have chosen sunday evening and it was a good idea, because the restaurant was quiet not with too much noise and people."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,1,1,2,"service catastrophique, planche √† partager qui arrive en m√™me temps que le plat, 2 milshake √† la place de 2 brownies
menu incompr√©hensible idem pour les menus enfants
serveurs qui ne parlent pas fran√ßais !!"
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,4,3,2,"The table was not confortable. We were in a corner and the over table was too close. When we book several days before, we hope for a good place. I was so disapointed about the place were we have been placed."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,2,3,3,"Food not up to par. Wait staff very friendly. Was there for a  Birthday dinner. They made it very pleasant.
Ribs were rather dry and burgers were overdone."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,1,5,"We booked a table reservation, when we arrived, we had to wait 20 minutes before a table was ready. Don't allow us to book a table if it's not available!
The service we received was not particularly brilliant! Our waitress seemed too busy chatting up her male colleagues then coming to serve us. On numerous times i tried to get her attention to ask for the bill and she ignored us.
Food was average, i had the pulled pork sandwich and it was just a huge lump of pork rather than melt away pulled pork."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,We visit wherever we go so this was a must. Great food that really hit the spot
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,4,5,4,"Had a great time- had previously been to the one in New York Times Square and preferred that one, the shop was also so much better but still had a brilliant time. Would visit again."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,2.0,2,2,4,3,"You go there for the fame of it.     Food was expensive for what it was.  I had combo chicken and pulled pork.  Not much meat on chicken leg and a tiny piece of grizzly chicken breast.   Food not  hot but lukewarm.  I didn't say anything to cause a fuss but it should be better quality and basically should be hot .

Apart from that. Service great. Ambience great .  Very warm welcome."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,2,4,"I had to alter my reservation time, which i did through open table and gained confirmation of the change but the restaurant had not record of this? Waitress was a little tipsy and left us waiting for side plates for the starters, forgot the milkshake and generally was a little forgetful. The manager swiftly rectified an under cooked burger and the overall experience was ok."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,3.0,3,3,4,4,With the Hard Rock you get what you get. Noisy and vibrant. Unfortunately when we visited they had no steaks of any form. Beyond that the menu is very limited
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,5,3,"Wir haben √ºber OpenTable leider nur einen mittelm√§√üigen Tisch im Hauptgang erhalten, daher war es sehr unruhig und hektisch.

Die Location ist ansonsten typisch Hard-Rock-Caf√© und es hat uns sehr gut geschmeckt."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,On arrival they did not have our reservation but they managed to get us in not very happy.
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Fatima is excellent!!!
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,5,4,4,"It's a little piece of America abroad. The space is small so seating is a little cramped, but it's everything you know and love from the Hard Rock Cafe chain."
Hard Rock Cafe - Paris,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Good restaurant, great service and good food. Margaritas very good."
Mamamia,1.0,1,2,3,3,Instead of telling us they could not accommodate the party size at that time due to them wanting to close early they still took us and only some of the party ate and they were out of food for everyone else. The server tried to make it up by giving dessert. We were there for a 30th birthday so it killed the birthday vibe.
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,1,1,"There was hair in my food and the photos were how it was handled. I‚Äôm disgusted. They didn‚Äôt even care, but told me there was more going on in the world. Ps- I paid for the food with hair before I left crying.

They won‚Äôt let me share the conversation photos. But I was told there are big things going on in the world  and this is not one of them"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Muy buen restaurante. Estuvimos en fin de a√±o y fue genial.
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,1,1,I will not post the full story but I would not go to this place ever again.  They should be shut down.
Mamamia,4.0,4,4,5,4,Very centrally located restaurant with delicious dishes and a very surprising dessert that mesmerized my son. Service was amazing. Wines very overpriced.
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Overpriced, subpar all the way around. Really rude host. Would not recommend. They didn‚Äôt even care that it was my birthday."
Mamamia,2.0,2,2,1,3,"We found this restaurant to be a total fake. In an Italian restaurant we were told that there was no garlic to make alioli pasta.
We notified them ahead of time that this my birthday and there was not even mention of it or any nice gesture
Prices were extravagant for the quality of the food.
My lamb was cold when it hit the table.
Overall it was a poor experience"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"C‚Äô√©tait parfait
L‚Äôambiance est tr√®s bonne surtout"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Lugar muy Nice, el servicio excelente bravo
Si quieres ir modo cena tranquilo, debes ir temprano, y‚Äôa luego se vuelve un poco ruidoso

El servicio excelente!!!
Los tragos y la comida deliciosa"
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,1,1,"I showed up at the restaurant and the door keepers said open table is not part of their reservation network. Then they proceded to physically remove me and my companion from the doorstep even though it was heavily raining, and dismissed any further communication after that, even though we could prove from the wide windows at the restaUrant that there were tables available. Never have i been so mistreated by staff in my life. Thankfully, the people at the Mandarin were most kind and welcomed us without a reservation, which was tough for a Saturday night. I strongly encourage all potential customers to stay away fron this restaurant."
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Service and food were both great! What a hip spot! There was a DJ playing cool music. Ambiance was super chill. Burrata was amazing. Seabass and baby chicken was great! Worth a try!
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,2,2,"Never again. I had the worst experience in my life. While I was having my drink I noticed something strange in the glass - it turned out to be an old receipt in the ice cube! When I complained, their reaction was just to bring a glass  of different wine. It goes without saying that I couldn‚Äôt enjoy my dinner after the incident."
Mamamia,4.0,4,5,5,4,Only reason I gave a 4 instead of 5 was because the music was too loud. My ears were ringing after leaving.
Mamamia,2.0,2,5,2,5,"Had a very bizzare experience at Mamamia. I booked a table for my birthday to have dinner with the party and DJ that Mamma Mia typically has. They refused to sit me upstairs and insisted on sitting me downstairs even though there was barely anybody sitting upstairs. They told me all of the tables were reserved. They also told me they can‚Äôt make any promises about where you will be sitting but clearly made exceptions to other people about sitting them upstairs? I told them I booked this dinner for my birthday and I wanted to sit upstairs and they told me maybe after I eat, I can sit upstairs. Then they tried to tell me after dinner if I wanted to sit upstairs, I would have to pay a minimum of $300 to buy a bottle for a VIP experience, which I didn‚Äôt have to do the last time that I was there. Part of me thought they were trying to take advantage of me because I was an American. overall did not have a great experience this visit. Maybe it is just hit or miss. The food was very good but the drinks were terrible."
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent food and amazing vibe the place one of a kind.
Mamamia,2.0,2,3,1,1,"not a great atmosphere, we where alone at a friday night with a few other tables. The waiter was litterally waiting next to our table to see when we finished our plate, very awkward. would not recommend it, felt like a tourist trap"
Mamamia,3.0,3,5,5,1,"Entertainment starts late, don't make a booking before 9.30 because you do get kicked off the table and are not allowed to enjoy the dj etc. was taken down to the club and when I left there was many tables in the restaurant that were empty but the staff still didn't allow me and my friend to sit there"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent
The service was very attentive
He food was delicious"
Mamamia,3.0,3,3,4,3,Went on a Sunday was a bit quiet than expected. The lobster pasta we wanted wasn‚Äôt available on the day nor pizza so settled for the beef and potatoes which was okay. My friend was recommended a different type of pasta and also had an octopus which she said tasted bland. Otherwise staffs were welcoming
Mamamia,3.0,3,2,3,3,"Very high energy, club type experience. Waiters were good but too busy. Food was not what it should be for the price. Fun night but not worth it."
Mamamia,2.0,2,4,1,3,Food is great but takes a while to come out. Staff is super unfriendly and unhelpful. We pointed out mistakes with the bill and the waitress responded with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for this‚Äù.
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,4,Friendly staff upbeat environment and tasty dishes. Music was a bit loud but we loved the atmosphere. Truffle Rigatoni was incredible!
Mamamia,3.0,3,5,1,3,"Amazing experience. However, our server had us waiting 10 minutes before providing a menu. When the menu was provided we were left for another 20 minutes waiting to order. Our food came pretty fast but there was a discrepancy with the orders. We were charged for the most expensive steak on the menu rather than the beef tenderloin. They weren‚Äôt helpful at all. Still demanded we pay and offered 3 watered down drinks"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Incredible food and ambiance.  The romantic candlelit vibe is a great accompaniment to the extraordinary service and food.  Before or after your dinner, be sure to grab a cocktail or champagne in their downstairs ‚Äúspeakeasy‚Äù like bar/cocktail club.

Note/Pro Tip: We added truffle to everything, as you can see from our photos!"
Mamamia,2.0,2,2,1,4,We took a chance on this place based on the reviews but was severely disappointed as it‚Äôs clearly geared towards impressing tourists that don‚Äôt know any better. The menu looks good but the taste of the food falls flat. For this price you can eat at dozens of other places in Paris where the food is worth the money. After a pretty bad meal I asked for the check and when I paid I was asked by the server to tip her! I was dumbfounded. Tips are not part of eating in restaurants in Europe and only unknowing Americans feel compelled to do so. I found this to be offensive and the last straw in what was a very disappointing night out. Stay away from this place and find one of the other hundreds of restaurants in Paris with better food and servers who aren‚Äôt asking for a tip.
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent service by our server!! Just Superb!
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food was unreal!! Decor was gorgeous. Great service. We booked at 9pm but could have done with a table a little later as it started getting busier and more fun around 10:30/11pm. Vibe was great we really enjoyed this!
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wonderful dinner on our last night.  Highly recommend the tiramisu.
Mamamia,4.0,4,5,4,5,"We had an amazing time! The only downfall is we had such a tiny table for the three of us and I was on the awkward part of the table. We asked to switch and there were a ton of open tables but we were told no. The food was amazing. We loved the atmosphere, aesthetic, vibe, performers and the Dj was the best!! We loved the music!"
Mamamia,3.0,3,3,4,3,"Service was good, the T-Bone steak was dry and on the bloody side, when asked for medium well! Sea Bass was good!"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Booked for the first time as I thought ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt go wrong with Italian‚Äù and I was proved right once again. Great food, great, atmosphere, great service‚Ä¶"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Highly recommend. Truffle rigatoni was one of the best pasta dishes I‚Äôve ever had!
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Everything was great! We loved the food, the vibe and the service. Highly recommended"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Wow wow wowwww! One of the best nights of our lives! We originally had a booked a table at another ‚Äòfestive‚Äô Paris restaurant, however we weren‚Äôt happy with that so we ended up making a very last minute reservation at mamamia.

For starters they were so welcoming to the fact it was so last minute and we got the best table! Everything was perfect from the drinks, the service, the food, and the vibe was 100000/10! We‚Äôve never danced so much! It was two of our birthdays and we have never been to Paris before, and honestly had so much fun.

Every single staff member there was so smiley and so attentive and just generally fun, even the DJ was so entertaining! . Mama Mia is one, if not the best restaurants we‚Äôve ever been to. Paris, we love you! Everything TikTok says about this restaurant being amazing, is true! This is your sign to go there. We loved it so much we‚Äôre going again tonight!"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing fun and music was on spot, loved it and will come again!"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,I went for my birthday and our waiter was outstanding!! Already planning my trip for next year!
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,4,3,"The worst meal I had in Paris. The food was not terrible but not worth it, and very Americanized. And I‚Äôm American. I was in a hurry and this was easier to stop in to versus reading reviews for a local restaurant. Unfortunately it was a close second to Olive Garden. Do yourself a favor and pass on this place. The entire waitstaff was attentive, but trying too hard, especially the girls."
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great food. Great service. Fun, club-like atmosphere."
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Tasty menu. Very attentive staff. Excellent wine. Nice atmosphere. Beautiful experience.
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,1,3,Much loud music and a terrible waitress. She couldn‚Äôt explain anything at the menu. The food was overpriced and doesn‚Äôt even taste well.
Mamamia,1.0,1,2,3,3,Instead of telling us they could not accommodate the party size at that time due to them wanting to close early they still took us and only some of the party ate and they were out of food for everyone else. The server tried to make it up by giving dessert. We were there for a 30th birthday so it killed the birthday vibe.
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,1,1,"There was hair in my food and the photos were how it was handled. I‚Äôm disgusted. They didn‚Äôt even care, but told me there was more going on in the world. Ps- I paid for the food with hair before I left crying.

They won‚Äôt let me share the conversation photos. But I was told there are big things going on in the world  and this is not one of them"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Muy buen restaurante. Estuvimos en fin de a√±o y fue genial.
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,1,1,I will not post the full story but I would not go to this place ever again.  They should be shut down.
Mamamia,4.0,4,4,5,4,Very centrally located restaurant with delicious dishes and a very surprising dessert that mesmerized my son. Service was amazing. Wines very overpriced.
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Overpriced, subpar all the way around. Really rude host. Would not recommend. They didn‚Äôt even care that it was my birthday."
Mamamia,2.0,2,2,1,3,"We found this restaurant to be a total fake. In an Italian restaurant we were told that there was no garlic to make alioli pasta.
We notified them ahead of time that this my birthday and there was not even mention of it or any nice gesture
Prices were extravagant for the quality of the food.
My lamb was cold when it hit the table.
Overall it was a poor experience"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"C‚Äô√©tait parfait
L‚Äôambiance est tr√®s bonne surtout"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Lugar muy Nice, el servicio excelente bravo
Si quieres ir modo cena tranquilo, debes ir temprano, y‚Äôa luego se vuelve un poco ruidoso

El servicio excelente!!!
Los tragos y la comida deliciosa"
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,1,1,"I showed up at the restaurant and the door keepers said open table is not part of their reservation network. Then they proceded to physically remove me and my companion from the doorstep even though it was heavily raining, and dismissed any further communication after that, even though we could prove from the wide windows at the restaUrant that there were tables available. Never have i been so mistreated by staff in my life. Thankfully, the people at the Mandarin were most kind and welcomed us without a reservation, which was tough for a Saturday night. I strongly encourage all potential customers to stay away fron this restaurant."
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Service and food were both great! What a hip spot! There was a DJ playing cool music. Ambiance was super chill. Burrata was amazing. Seabass and baby chicken was great! Worth a try!
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,2,2,"Never again. I had the worst experience in my life. While I was having my drink I noticed something strange in the glass - it turned out to be an old receipt in the ice cube! When I complained, their reaction was just to bring a glass  of different wine. It goes without saying that I couldn‚Äôt enjoy my dinner after the incident."
Mamamia,4.0,4,5,5,4,Only reason I gave a 4 instead of 5 was because the music was too loud. My ears were ringing after leaving.
Mamamia,2.0,2,5,2,5,"Had a very bizzare experience at Mamamia. I booked a table for my birthday to have dinner with the party and DJ that Mamma Mia typically has. They refused to sit me upstairs and insisted on sitting me downstairs even though there was barely anybody sitting upstairs. They told me all of the tables were reserved. They also told me they can‚Äôt make any promises about where you will be sitting but clearly made exceptions to other people about sitting them upstairs? I told them I booked this dinner for my birthday and I wanted to sit upstairs and they told me maybe after I eat, I can sit upstairs. Then they tried to tell me after dinner if I wanted to sit upstairs, I would have to pay a minimum of $300 to buy a bottle for a VIP experience, which I didn‚Äôt have to do the last time that I was there. Part of me thought they were trying to take advantage of me because I was an American. overall did not have a great experience this visit. Maybe it is just hit or miss. The food was very good but the drinks were terrible."
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent food and amazing vibe the place one of a kind.
Mamamia,2.0,2,3,1,1,"not a great atmosphere, we where alone at a friday night with a few other tables. The waiter was litterally waiting next to our table to see when we finished our plate, very awkward. would not recommend it, felt like a tourist trap"
Mamamia,3.0,3,5,5,1,"Entertainment starts late, don't make a booking before 9.30 because you do get kicked off the table and are not allowed to enjoy the dj etc. was taken down to the club and when I left there was many tables in the restaurant that were empty but the staff still didn't allow me and my friend to sit there"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent
The service was very attentive
He food was delicious"
Mamamia,3.0,3,3,4,3,Went on a Sunday was a bit quiet than expected. The lobster pasta we wanted wasn‚Äôt available on the day nor pizza so settled for the beef and potatoes which was okay. My friend was recommended a different type of pasta and also had an octopus which she said tasted bland. Otherwise staffs were welcoming
Mamamia,3.0,3,2,3,3,"Very high energy, club type experience. Waiters were good but too busy. Food was not what it should be for the price. Fun night but not worth it."
Mamamia,2.0,2,4,1,3,Food is great but takes a while to come out. Staff is super unfriendly and unhelpful. We pointed out mistakes with the bill and the waitress responded with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for this‚Äù.
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,4,Friendly staff upbeat environment and tasty dishes. Music was a bit loud but we loved the atmosphere. Truffle Rigatoni was incredible!
Mamamia,3.0,3,5,1,3,"Amazing experience. However, our server had us waiting 10 minutes before providing a menu. When the menu was provided we were left for another 20 minutes waiting to order. Our food came pretty fast but there was a discrepancy with the orders. We were charged for the most expensive steak on the menu rather than the beef tenderloin. They weren‚Äôt helpful at all. Still demanded we pay and offered 3 watered down drinks"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Incredible food and ambiance.  The romantic candlelit vibe is a great accompaniment to the extraordinary service and food.  Before or after your dinner, be sure to grab a cocktail or champagne in their downstairs ‚Äúspeakeasy‚Äù like bar/cocktail club.

Note/Pro Tip: We added truffle to everything, as you can see from our photos!"
Mamamia,2.0,2,2,1,4,We took a chance on this place based on the reviews but was severely disappointed as it‚Äôs clearly geared towards impressing tourists that don‚Äôt know any better. The menu looks good but the taste of the food falls flat. For this price you can eat at dozens of other places in Paris where the food is worth the money. After a pretty bad meal I asked for the check and when I paid I was asked by the server to tip her! I was dumbfounded. Tips are not part of eating in restaurants in Europe and only unknowing Americans feel compelled to do so. I found this to be offensive and the last straw in what was a very disappointing night out. Stay away from this place and find one of the other hundreds of restaurants in Paris with better food and servers who aren‚Äôt asking for a tip.
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent service by our server!! Just Superb!
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food was unreal!! Decor was gorgeous. Great service. We booked at 9pm but could have done with a table a little later as it started getting busier and more fun around 10:30/11pm. Vibe was great we really enjoyed this!
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wonderful dinner on our last night.  Highly recommend the tiramisu.
Mamamia,4.0,4,5,4,5,"We had an amazing time! The only downfall is we had such a tiny table for the three of us and I was on the awkward part of the table. We asked to switch and there were a ton of open tables but we were told no. The food was amazing. We loved the atmosphere, aesthetic, vibe, performers and the Dj was the best!! We loved the music!"
Mamamia,3.0,3,3,4,3,"Service was good, the T-Bone steak was dry and on the bloody side, when asked for medium well! Sea Bass was good!"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Booked for the first time as I thought ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt go wrong with Italian‚Äù and I was proved right once again. Great food, great, atmosphere, great service‚Ä¶"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Highly recommend. Truffle rigatoni was one of the best pasta dishes I‚Äôve ever had!
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Everything was great! We loved the food, the vibe and the service. Highly recommended"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Wow wow wowwww! One of the best nights of our lives! We originally had a booked a table at another ‚Äòfestive‚Äô Paris restaurant, however we weren‚Äôt happy with that so we ended up making a very last minute reservation at mamamia.

For starters they were so welcoming to the fact it was so last minute and we got the best table! Everything was perfect from the drinks, the service, the food, and the vibe was 100000/10! We‚Äôve never danced so much! It was two of our birthdays and we have never been to Paris before, and honestly had so much fun.

Every single staff member there was so smiley and so attentive and just generally fun, even the DJ was so entertaining! . Mama Mia is one, if not the best restaurants we‚Äôve ever been to. Paris, we love you! Everything TikTok says about this restaurant being amazing, is true! This is your sign to go there. We loved it so much we‚Äôre going again tonight!"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing fun and music was on spot, loved it and will come again!"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,I went for my birthday and our waiter was outstanding!! Already planning my trip for next year!

Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great food and atmosphere. Trying to fill 59 words
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Amazing service and food loved it so much and will be coming back
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Visita en Paris
Muy buen lugar , muy buena comida"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,An unforgettable experience! Book this place for dinner and drinks and you will not regret it.
Mamamia,3.0,3,3,4,4,Nice place quite chic but quality food is not at the level of the bill.
Mamamia,2.0,2,3,1,3,"The host was very rude and full of racism , and almost waiters were really rude, they bumped on my chair every time they passed without caring. Even after I told them to stop doing it they didn‚Äôt."
Mamamia,5.0,5,4,5,5,Reunited with some friends and had the best experience yet!
Mamamia,2.0,2,2,1,4,"Didn‚Äôt want to let us in but showed them on the app they have like 7 times slots open , very rude at door. Food was ok but way over priced ! Drinks are 30$ per drink as well."
Mamamia,4.0,4,5,5,5,Great vibe - long wait for table and service but server was amazing and food very good
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I never leave reviews but listen, if you visit Paris you HAVE to come here. Everything was 10/10. My boyfriend and I had such an amazing time. The lobster pasta was great and the drinks were even better!"
Mamamia,4.0,4,5,5,4,"Lobster pasta was the best
Steak is ok"
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Open table allowed us to book for lunch at 14:30 but when we got there we were turned away and not served due to the kitchen being closed at 14:30, the waitress gave me a card and sent us away.

Very disappointing experience."
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Our waitress was so much FUN! The entire restaurant is full of energy- the wife and I really enjoyed everything about our dinning experience here! We are from USA and have traveled all over the world this restaurant will be a place we visit again next time we are in Paris.
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,1,1,Did not honor our reservations via Open Table
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,1,1,"We arrived, first they said they dint hav"
Mamamia,1.0,1,2,2,3,"Staff was so rude. Hosts were rude, out of line and not dressed appropriately for such an expensive restaurant nor for Christmas weekend. We were at the restaurant for almost 4 hours because the service was slow, our food was cold, waited 25 minutes for silverware, and then had to wait an extra 30 minutes just to retrieve our checked coats. The hostess refused to hand us our jackets saying thats not her job, made us stand there in the way of everything all while other people handed her their coats. She was also rude to the family next to us. Seriously unacceptable, especially on Christmas Eve."
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,1,1,The restaurant was supposed to open on 24th but instead it was closed‚Ä¶
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Very nice and cosy restaurant and the food is fantastic! Please try their truffle pizza! The service is very good as well!!! My biggest recommendations to Mamamia.
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We loved this place! The food, the service, the entertainment- everything was superb:-) we highly recommend it to anyone that wants to have fun and happy evening!! Thank you Mamamia for making our experience special."
Mamamia,1.0,1,4,1,1,"We‚Äôve been in Paris for three days and have had incredible meals with incredible service. Our experience at Mamamia was not pleasant. We started by ordering two bottles of wine for a group of six people. She immediately told me that a sweeter wine would be better. I am a wine collector so know what I like. She insisted on opening a sweeter wine. We didn‚Äôt like it and ended up going with our original order. When she went to pour the wine, she poured on the table, on two people and into a water glass with water. We then placed our food orders. She forgot one of the orders and that order didn‚Äôt come out until after the rest of the party was done with their meals. Before dinner, we ordered a red wine to accompany dinner. When the wine came out she tried to pour the test glass into our existing white wine glasses. We had to ask for different glasses for our red wine. When the bill came it clearly stated that service was included(see attached). After the bill was paid she came back and said that she did not receive gratuity and asked us to pay more. In addition, the music was so loud that you could not talk across the table. Overall this was an awful experience. If you are an American, avoid this place. They will come after you for unearned gratuity and treat you as lower citizens."
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excelente atenci√≥n, fue una velada incre√≠ble, gracias a todos por sus servicios"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Lovely staff and service and delicious food :) 
Went there for my birthday dinner with my friends, great atmosphere, we had a great time :)."
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Everything was great. Not sure about the few bad reviews. It was a slightly higher price but the food quality was worth it. Everything we had was very well done and the service was astounding as well.
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"What a wonderful experience! Went with girlfriends to celebrate a birthday and the music, service and ambiance was wonderful!!"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Beautiful interior, nice ambience, good music with DJ on Saturday night. Octopus and seafood risotto 10/10. Great place for the fun hangout. We loved place and will definitely come back when next time we will be in Paris!"
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Made reservation, took a taxi there for them to tell us they wouldn‚Äôt honor the reservation."
Mamamia,1.0,1,3,3,3,Made a reservation and arrived only to be told the restaurant was closed. It looks like a nice place but it was a waste of a taxi for me to arrive and have to just find somewhere else. The restaurant should either follow the posted hours or change them if they‚Äôre inaccurate
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great place
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Ein insgesamt sehr gutes und g√ºnstiges Essen f√ºr Paris.
Leider entsprachen die Preise f√ºr die Men√ºs nicht dem auf der Karte angegebenen Preis. Daf√ºr ein leichter Abzug beim Preis-Leistungs-Verh√§ltnis.

Sonst wirklich alles Top. Leckeres Essen und super Service."
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Convenient location. Pleasant reception. Knowledgeable staff. Inviting Ambience. Great good.
Mamamia,1.0,1,4,1,1,The staff didn‚Äôt have any interest in us. The food was lovely but extremely expensive! Would not go here again and do not recommend if you‚Äôre visiting Paris
Mamamia,1.0,1,1,1,1,Bad everything
Mamamia,2.0,2,5,4,1,"A very mixed experience. 
The restaurant is very well located, very close to Ave Georges V, is attractive and the food and service were top notch‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶however, at 10pm they started blasting us with techno music tat was thumping and incredibly loud. We asked the manager to turn it down and we were told that ‚Äúit is part of the concept‚Äù. We left as soon as we finished our dinner and so a number of people doing the same.
Recommended: yes, but by all means leave before 10pm."
Mamamia,2.0,2,2,3,3,"Not really a restaurant for the food, more like a party place and when we went it was very empty. I would not recommended"
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Outstanding service , food and drinks . The restaurants is very modern , elegant and special"
Mamamia,2.0,2,2,4,3,"The food was over priced. 41euros for rizzotto with one cut up shrimp and it was bland. Not sure how but the truffle riggiton had little flavor. iIf must eat here get the beef filet, it was reasonable and prepared well. The baratta appetizer was good. Was hoping for better."
Mamamia,3.0,3,3,4,3,My children and I enjoyed a delicious dinner here during our trip to Paris. Thank you for a great meal and warm hospitality
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Everything was amazing, the foods delicious and the service kind, professional."
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,We had a wonderful meal here - food and service were outstanding!
Mamamia,1.0,1,3,1,1,"Food quality good but constant thumping from DJ requires yelling even at intimate tables. Serving staff not attentive and require multiple ""flag downs"". Too many chairs and tables in the space which caused multiple chair hits by staff running around."
Mamamia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food was great. The sauce on the chicken was the best thing ever. I could drink it like soup. The duck was tender and well seasoned.
Mamamia,2.0,2,2,2,4,Eh.... that's all I can say....
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,4,4,"Ce restaurant enti√®rement vegan propose diff√©rents tapas et types de sushis, avec menu d√©gustation, ainsi que du sak√© froid √† d√©guster comme vin de table, et des cocktails et mocktails tr√®s sympas.

Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Tout √©tait d√©licieux, aussi bien les plats que les cocktails ( mention sp√©ciale pour le Kawai ). Mes coll√®gues et moi avons ador√© !"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,5,4,3,Tables were too close together and very small. Candles on already crowded tables were a fire hazard. Our decorations caught on fire.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,3.0,3,3,2,3,"Le service laissait √† d√©sirer.  On sentait que l'on d√©rangeait,  que l'ont √©tait de trop. 
Rapport qualit√© prix discutable."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,2.0,2,2,1,3,"Pour du v√©g√©tarien / vegan on s‚Äôattend √† avoir des v√©ritables saveurs mais ce n‚Äôest pas sp√©cialement bien travaill√©, c‚Äôest assez fade, hormis les entr√©es.
C‚Äôest vraiment dommage.

Quant au service, le personnel n‚Äôest pas tr√®s souriant et tr√®s ¬´¬†speed¬†¬ª ce qui rend l‚Äôexp√©rience moins sympa."

Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,5,4,5,"Plats d√©licieux (surtout Maki Katsu curry)! Entrees un peu petites et peut √™tre serait ce bien d‚Äôavoir un peu plus de crevettes (crispy shrimp) mais encore une fois tr√®s bonnes. Cocktails honn√™tes avec doses impeccables. Le barman √©tait tres serviable et une serveuse aussi, mais une autre √©tait assez nonchalante, lente et manquait un peu d‚Äôamabilit√©. Mais ambiance aussi g√©niale donc √ßa passait"

Bloom Sushi Wagram,1.0,1,1,1,1,Restaurant qui joue sur l‚Äôessort du tout v√©g√©tal pour gonfler les prix. Le personnel parle entre eux assez fort de leurs histoires personnelles. Je ne conseille absolument pas.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Tr√®s original

Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Super restaurant vegan ! Meilleure sushi de Paris, plats exceptionnels, personnels au top tr√®s agr√©able, je recommande 1000009 fois"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,2,3,"Points positifs :

- 100% vegan.
- Mets tr√®s originaux et on sent que tout est fait maison avec des ingr√©dients frais et de qualit√©.
- Certains sushis sont exquis, vraies belles d√©couvertes de saveurs.
- Menu double int√©ressant pour d√©couvrir un bon assortiment de sushis quand on vient pour la 1√® fois.
- Cadre agr√©able.
- Le mocktail Kawai love est √† tomber.

Points n√©gatifs :

- Accueil et service un peu froids.
- Nous aurions appr√©ci√© un service un peu plus lent pour mieux profiter de notre soir√©e. Les entr√©es arrivent tout de suite apr√®s que les ap√©ritifs aient √©t√© servis (cocktail + soupe miso, pas la meilleure association). Nous avons demand√© √† attendre un peu avant la suite, mais les sushis sont quand m√™me arriv√©s rapidement apr√®s...
- Au niveau des sushis, √ßa passe ou √ßa casse, certains sont d√©licieux, d'autres un peu fades.
- Le menu n'est pas clair, et une fois servis on ne sait plus ce qu'il y a dans l'assortiment. C'est dommage de ne pas savoir ce que l'on mange exactement sans solliciter les serveurs, et pas pratique si on veut revenir et commander √† la carte.
- Il n'y avait plus de fondant au chocolat ni certains parfums de mocchis lors de notre visite."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,This was the best vegan sushi I've ever had. Staff was very polite and the restaurant is nicely decorated.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,3,3,5,"Ambiance agr√©able, d√©co tr√®s tr√®s chouette jusqu‚Äôaux toilettes.
Par contre selon moi les portions des sushis et autres douceurs de la cartes sont √† revoir pour la plupart √† la hausse. Franchement c‚Äôest tout riquiqui pour un prix qui lui ne l‚Äôest pas. Les saveurs sont certainement l√† mais sur si peu pour moi c‚Äôest difficile √† dire.
Bref il faut am√©liorer le rapport qualit√© prix selon moi. A minima pour durer"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Amazing Vegan experience. Delicious!! ( we are not vegan but we wanted to try upper class vegan food) success! Very good service!! Must try is the sweet potato fries with its sauce!
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,4,4,3,"Very nice vegan sushi restaurant, very original. The omakase menu has good variety but I'd like to come back to test out other recipe."

Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,5,4,5,"Plats tr√®s originaux et tr√®s bons.
La terrasse a √©t√© un peu bruyante du √† des voitures qui passent pas tr√®s loin.
La service a √©t√© tr√®s professionnelle et au top jusqu'√† la derni√®re commande (car ils ont oubli√© le th√© que j'avais command√© - pas rien de grave).
Merci de cette experience culinaire tr√®s originale !"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,4,5,"For our first time trying vegan sushis, it was an amazing discovery. Not only the food is incredible, but the drinks are too!"

Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Mon premier restaurant vegan gastronomique : une r√©ussite.
D√©licieux, original, beau. Surtout le sal√©. Un bon vin blanc fruit√©.
Service impeccable, le personnel conna√Æt bien les produits.
Merci !"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Des recettes tr√®s originales tout en respectant certains classiques japonais.
Nous avons pass√© un tr√®s bon moment.
Les plats sont tr√®s color√©s et le dressing remarquable!

Le cocktail √©tait tr√®s bien √©quilibr√©.

Le chocolat du fondant √©tait un peu trop noir √† mon go√ªt, mais c'est personnel.

Je recommande !"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Tr√®s belle d√©couverte. Des plats tr√®s bien pr√©sent√©s et bluffants. De nombreuses saveurs tr√®s agr√©ables. Avec un service poli et efficace, c'est tr√®s agr√©able Clairement √† recommander et √† recommencer üëçüå∏"

You must test Bloom"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"A charming place where vegans and sushi lovers will find a really tasty choice. A special note for desserts: simply wonderful! 
A restaurant to try and where to return!"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,3.0,3,3,3,3,"Nice place, this is the 3rd times I come here. Menu is not as good as it was last year. I wonder if they hv changed the staff. Price doesn‚Äôt match quality, but it is still a correct place to go for diner"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,A tester ! Meilleurs sushis et makis vegan de Paris! Approuv√© meme par un non vegan üëçüèº
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,One of the best vegan restaurant I‚Äôve tried so far. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Mon nouveau restaurant pr√©f√©r√© √† paris.

Oui le prix peut sembler √©lev√©, mais les plats sont incroyables, donc le rapport qualit√© prix est tr√®s bon.
Mention sp√©ciale pour les crispy rice et les hosso makis pleurote tempura. 

Je dirai que le seul point mitig√© est le service, car malheureusement les plats n‚Äôarrivent pas tous en m√™me temps si vous commandez plein de sushis hors menu. Peut √™tre √† pr√©ciser lors de la commande ?

Le cocktail Sprits revisit√© est excellent, le kawai love sans alcool tr√®s sucr√© donc faites attention si ce n‚Äôest pas votre truc. 

Globalement je maintiens la premi√®re ligne de cet avis, c‚Äôest un superbe restaurant, ambiance cozy, sushis excellents, bons cocktails. Allez y sans vous poser de questions !"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,3.0,3,5,1,3,"Food was amazing‚Ä¶., but service could've been better. The restaurant was empty with only a few tables occupied. We had to call the waiters multiple times and the service was really slow."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Le menu duo permet de d√©couvrir plein de sushi diff√©rents, vari√©s, vraiment tr√®s bon.
Un super restaurant pour les v√©g√©tarien.nes / v√©g√©talien.nes / pescitarien.nes, beaucoup de choix et pas de prise de t√™te puisque tout est un r√©gal pour les papilles !"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,4,5,5,Good food and good service. Fresh products. Original sushis.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,4,Never thought Plant Based Sushi could be this good
Bloom Sushi Wagram,2.0,2,4,1,1,"Le service √©tait terrible, en ayant r√©serv√© nous avons attendu 30 minutes pour commander alors que nous √©tions arriv√©s √† l'heure ! 
Pendant ce temps, nous observons des tabl√©es de 4-5 personnes arriver sans r√©servation et se faire servir avant m√™me que nous ayons command√©.
Les serveuses n'√©taient pas aimables et n'√©taient que deux pour s'occuper de tout le restaurant et en plus g√©rer le bar.
La nourriture √©tait cependant d√©licieuse, les produits sont de qualit√©, √ßa vaut son prix.
Passez votre tour sur les desserts qui ne valent pas grand chose."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"It was exceptionnel ! The food is delicious, and all is vegan. The staff is very nice üòä"

Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Ce restaurant est une tr√®s belle d√©couverte. J‚Äôai h√¢te d‚Äôy revenir.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,4,4,"Overall great experience, our whole table loved it ! But for a business lunch, within a limited slot of time, it was quite long... We waited quite a while for the food to arrive - but it's comprehensible, as everything seemed made on the spot & super fresh. But the presentation & the dishes were truly great, lovely and tasty. The only thing would be : it's seriously pricey... 4‚Ç¨ for one single mochi ice cream ? Come on."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,4,5,Might be a but expensive for sushis but very well served and tasty
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I went at Bloom restaurant because, like the Chef, I think we can't no more eat fish due to the massive extinction and global warming that affects the ocean (we need for breath). My children (16 and 23) really enjoy the restaurant and the food. And at the end, I ask for birthday candle on the dessert and it was very nice. All the staf came and song for my daughter. I hope that more restaurants (plants based food) like Bloom will open everywhere, or that more restaurants will adopt the same philosophy : if we love oceans (and we need them), we have to protect them and stop fishing."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Magnifique exp√©rience culinaire d√©licieux de l‚Äôentr√©e au dessert. Menu d√©couverte pour 2 avec 28 pi√®ces. C‚Äô√©tait incroyable. 
En dessert des mochis maison exquis."

Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,4,3,"Tr√®s bon dans l'ensemble, petit coup de c≈ìur pour le plat ""Mr. Crunch"". Des m√©langes qui peuvent parfois √©tonner mais agr√©ablement surpris √† chaque fois"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Very nice place, really cosy designs inside, food was amazing, I came with my non-vegan parents whom are quite hesitating about going to a vegan place and they really enjoyed their food and drinks ! We all enjoyed our time at Bloom, thanks the team for this nice moment."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,4,4,"Des sushis excellent et v√©g√©tariens, une tr√®s belle d√©coration et des serveurs agr√©ables, j'ai pass√© un tr√®s bon moment !

J'y retournerai !"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We were delighted to dine at Bloom vegan. Unique menu items offered flavorful food, superb drinks, and a welcoming ambiance. As vegetarians, our sushi options are usually quite limited. Bloom offered sumptuous options that hit on all counts!
Thank you chef and staff at Bloom for making our dinner an exceptional experience!"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing vegan sushis. This is art! 

We discovered them in Montreal almost 10 years ago, and we cannot be happier to find this same taste in Paris!!

I highly highly recommend and try different ones.

Cannot wait to go back and try the entire menu!!"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,3.0,3,3,3,3,"C'est le concept  original qui m'a attir√©.
Je m'attendais √† beaucoup plus de saveurs. Je ne regrette pas d'avoir test√©, en revanche, je ne pense pas y retourner, d'autant que le rapport qualit√© prix est un peu cher pour ce que c'est."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,A unique experience to share with a friendly staff

Je reviendrai pour les plats absolument superbes."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Tout √©tait tr√®s bon et le cadre vraiment agr√©able 
Prise de commande longue et oubli

The price was reasonable.  We will come back for sure !!"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Tout √©tait excellent, une petite remarque si je puis me permettre : faire attention aux clients qui sont aux tables √† l'ext√©rieur. Il est vrai que le restaurant √©tait bien rempli, mais nous avons d√ª attendre un peu avant de pouvoir commander le dessert. Sinon tout √©tait incroyable, comme toujours."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,3,4,5,Pretty good food.  Nice ambience.  Friendly servers.  Probably too expensive for the amount and quality.  Not sure I'd go back.  Maybe for one of the sushi rolls I ordered.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The place is beautiful and the food is so good, I strongly recommend it !"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,D√©licieux. Service tr√®s agr√©able. Un peu cher mais la qualit√© et le bon moment pass√© rattrape cela.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,4,Le repas √©tait vraiment tr√®s bon ! Tr√®s surprise des associations de saveurs. Je recommande fortement :)
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,C‚Äôest l‚Äôun des meilleurs sushis de ma vie et Je mange de la viande. Le service est super et les prix sont vraiment raisonnable
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Tr√®s bon accueil, personnel accommodant. La nourriture √©tait d√©licieuse avec des saveurs tr√®s originales pour des makis en tout genre. Les cocktails √©taient √©galement tr√®s r√©ussis"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,3.0,3,3,5,5,"Visuellement de tr√®s beau sushis et autres plats √ßa on ne peut rien dire 
Mais trop petits et ou trop peu : 2 petits arancini ou 1 petit moshi glac√©‚Ä¶ en plus pour le prix correspondant.m.
Quand au go√ªt oui ils sont bons mais comme dans d‚Äôautres restaurants asiatiques"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,2,4,"Premi√®re fois, nous avons voulu d√©couvrir ce restaurant sushi enti√®rement v√©g√©tal et suite auy recommandations du serveur nous avons opt√© pour le menu d√©couverte double... Malheureusement nous avons √©t√© mal conseill√©, le serveur ne connaissait visiblement pas le contenu du menu et nous avait indiqu√© d'autres sushis dans celui-ci... nous l'avons d√©couvert en recevant le plateau... Dommage. 
En dehors de cela les gyozas √©tait excellent, la soupe miso normal, les edamame par contre trop cuit et les sushi maki pour la plupart manquait d'assaisonnement. 
De plus √† la fin lors du r√®glement, nous d√©couvrons que le paiement par carte n'√©tait pas possible et la personne qui nous a install√© n'a a priori pas pens√© que cela pouvait avoir son importance. 
L'exp√©rience ne fut pas tr√®s satisfaite mais je mets tout de m√™me un 4 pour encouragements parce que un sushi enti√®rement v√©g√©tal reste une premi√®re pour moi"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,4,4,Best vegan sushis I have ever had. Better than traditional sushis. I recommend.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Lovely place and amazing food! I highly recommend it !

Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Concept original √† tester absolument.

Serveurs tr√®s souriants, aimables et professionnels. Ce fut un moment agr√©able."

Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"C'√©tait incroyable. Ce restaurant est vraiment d'une grande qualit√©, les sushis vegan √©tait un d√©lice. Le service √©tait lui aussi tr√®s agr√©able, tout comme la d√©co. Je reviendrai souvent."

We enjoyed our dinner and would recommend."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Les meilleurs sushis que j‚Äôai mang√© moi qui ne suis pas un grand fan des sushis d‚Äôordinaire. Mais l√† quelle belle surprise: aspect, consistance, originalit√©, et bien s√ªr go√ªt sont vraiment au top, et tout cela sans mettre en p√©ril la ressource halieutique. Un grand bravo au talentueux chef et √† l‚Äô√©quipe en salle pour leur gentillesse et efficacit√©."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,This place was an excellent find for anyone who does not eat fish or meat but loves sushi! The flavours were amazing and the staff was great
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Lovely vegan sushi restaurant.  We ordered the lunch combo for 2 which included a miso soup, edamame, gyozas and sushi platter.  The miso soup was nice, the edamame were okay but I‚Äôve had better.  Gyozas were nice but I prefer steamed to fried (personal preference).  Best part was the sushi with the variety of creative and tasty flavours.  If I was to visit again, I‚Äôd probably just stick with the sushi only.  Also ordered dessert which was very nice.  Overall good value.  Would re-visit if I was in Paris again and would recommend."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food and beverages were delicious. We enjoyed our evening.

L‚Äôaccueil et le service vraiment au TOP !"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,The best vegan sushi experience in Paris! Must eat :)
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,4,4,"La nourriture tr√®s bonne et la qulit√© au rdv. De fa√ßon g√©n√©rale, mais on aurrait aim√© avoir des marqueurs de saveur un peu plus forts et asiatiques qui rappellent un peu plus au sushis. 

On a dor√© les gyozas et le krispy roll √† la patate douce. 

Cocktail Kawaii tr√®s bon et tr√®s fruit√©e mais on aurait aim√© sentir un peu plus le vodka.

Dessert original et bien garni au ganache au chocolat. On a bien aim√© la mousse qui √©tait super a√©rienne. Cependant, il manquait peut-√™tre un peu plus de texture au d√©ssert pour qu'il soit parfait (une couche de gateau, une tuile, etc).  

Concept de resto original, fort appr√©ci√© ! On ne trouve pas facilement des sushis v√©gans √† Paris. 

Merci."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Original, bon, raffin√© le tout pour un tarif tr√®s raisonnable compte tenu des produits propos√©s"

Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent restaurant de cuisine japonaise vegan je ne pensais pas pouvoir autant appr√©cier les sushis sans poisson cru! Bravo
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Cosy and beautiful. Bloom is a great restaurant for anyone who wants to taste vegan cuisine translated into creative sushi / maki / california rolls. 

Wide range of choices for a reasonnable price. Ideal for a date."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,4,5,5,The interior is beautiful and stylish and the food was great too
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,3,4,Nice restaurant but the service was a bit slow and the food was not incredible. Good but nothing fantastic. I really enjoyed the interior decoration.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,4,3,Very tasty. I recommand the Dragon eyes.Good service.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wonderful! Staff was very polite and attentive. I thought everything I was served was excellent.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Parfait, √©tonnant, vraiment bon, prix tr√®s correct, service agr√©able ! Bravo."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,3.0,3,4,3,3,"Il est dommage que pour une r√©servation √† 21h30 on vienne vous dire que la cuisine ferme √† 23h et qu‚Äôil faut se d√©p√™cher de commander.
A 22h30 nous n‚Äôavons pas pu recommander de plats suppl√©mentaires la cuisine √©tait d√©j√† en train de ranger et nettoyer. Et c‚Äô√©tait un peu short pour les desserts.
Vraiment dommage d‚Äôavoir le sentiment d‚Äô√™tre pouss√© dehors si vite alors que l‚Äôambiance du resto, la d√©co et la qualit√© de la nourriture vous poussent √† savourer le moment !
Merci"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Super moment, 
Service au top, les mets sont raffin√©s et tr√®s bons"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Des makis vegan incroyable, c'est si dur de faire un choix !!"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,4,4,"It was nice and quiet with candles at the tables , the sushi‚Äôs and vegetarians varieties were tast and good , I loved it especially Rosso and Philadelphia it was delicious also the ice tea maison was very good"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,3.0,3,4,1,4,"The sushi was good. The blond waiter, however, was impolite and full of himself, and treated us poorly, rejecting to speak french even though we asked to speak french 3 times with him. Apparently my B2 certificate, that has allowed me to work in french and speak to everyone else in France and Switzerland, was not good enough for him."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Perfect! Thank you for the candle on the desert!!!
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The food was amazing, I was really impressed with the Philly roll and the mochi of course!"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Nous avons pass√© un tr√®s bon moment, le lieu est magnifique, et les plats d'une tr√®s grande qualit√©.
Nous avons √©t√© surpris par l'association des saveurs, et avons h√¢te d'y retourner"

Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,3,4,"Belle d√©couverte et exp√©rience. 
Cuisine qui a du go√ªt."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Tres bon sushis original, service souriant, rien √† dire √† refaire"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I went to Bloom on a saturday evening with my father and I could not be more satisfied : not only the food was excellent but also, the service was great. You can ask food recommendations, craftmanship knowledge or just have a quick chat about the wine. Very important and hardly done : you don‚Äôt have to ask for tap water, they immediately bring it with th√© wine!
Our bottle of Crozes-Hermitage was unfortunately corked and even that was dealt smoothly and quickly so not a bad note as well! 
Finally, I was happy to observe such a warm atmosphere in a food world full of dark restaurant rooms.
For sure I will come back and recommend the place."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,5,4,4,Great food with very original combinations of flavors.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Incroyable!!! Magnifique!! Sensationnel!!! C‚Äôetait superrrr!!!
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Jamais d√©√ßue de ce restaurant. Les meilleurs sushi vegan.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,5,5,4,"Excellent restaurant original, bon rapport qualit√© prix lors du d√©jeuner"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Very good vegan sushis very original and tasty. Personnaly I don't like mushrooms and there is a very good choice without mushrooms. 
I came with my little dog and he has been very welcome"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Best vegan experience in Paris. I loved it so much. Can‚Äôt wait to come back.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,3,"I‚Äôts an excellent restaurant (food is delicious, decoration is soothing). I would definitely comeback. However, the noise is quite high and tables are really close to each other which affects privacy. One guy who seems to be the owner looks really arrogant and makes me feel uncomfortable."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,5,5,"We went right after the opening date in January and were absolutely amazed, very creative food, on the slightly expensive side but so worth it! We returned a month after and the portion had been divided in half for the same price, we had to order twice of what we did last time to feel full and, consequently, paid double‚Ä¶ a bit disappointing."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,3,4,5,"I‚Äôve been to the Bloom twice: on a regular day and on a special Valentine‚Äôs Day dinner with special menu. I really enjoyed all the dishes and pleasant, soothing ambience on the regular day with regular menu. But I can‚Äôt say the same about Valentine‚Äôs Day dinner - it felt like it wasn‚Äôt worth the price: nearly half of the announced sushi rolls for the main course were just spring rolls with beetroot and rice with very bland and pronounced beet taste. The dessert was a complete disappointment: just piped chocolate cream with store bought (!) whipped topping and sprinkle of rice crisps and very shy drizzle of caramel. I even can‚Äôt call it a proper dessert in a restaurant, I would have never ordered and paid for it if it wasn‚Äôt included in the menu. I hope that in the future they will keep just serving mochis."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Un repas d√©licieux, o√π nous avons d√©couvert de nouvelles saveurs ! Les quantit√©s √©taient g√©n√©reuses"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Trip to Paris
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent place to eat excellent plant-based food! Just excellent :) Can‚Äôt stress enough how much I like this place! I keep coming for the food, the service and the ambience; one of the best places I‚Äôve ever been to in Paris"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,4,4,"I really want to like this restaurant more, because the decor is really nice and vegan sushi is so rare. But I had to take one star off because I asked for a table near the window during reservation and they put us next to the kitchen even though the window seats were free. It was crammed and noisy. We also had to wait quite long for one of our sushi, like they forgot."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,L‚Äôendroit est tr√®s agr√©able et le personnel tr√®s sympa. La nourriture √©tait d√©licieuse mais les proportions un peu insuffisantes par rapport au prix..
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent, tr√®s bon repas, assez surprenant surtout le faux saumon et tr√®s bon service"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,5,3,4,Au top sauf l‚Äôattente mais la nourriture est incroyable et pas tr√®s cher

Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Super exp√©rience : premier restaurant vegan, pas d√©√ßue du tout. Tout est d√©licieux, le service est rapide et soign√©. 
A refaire!"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"top, √ßa donne envie d'y retourner pour tout tester. La carte des boissons est aussi tr√®s soign√©e (cidre yuzu, vin, umeshu, cocktails etc.)."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Un diner d√©licieux, un bel accueil jeune et sympathique"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Super exp√©rience, le lieu est tr√®s sympa, le service est rapide, les serveurs sont tous tr√®s gentils et serviables !
Et les sushis sont incroyables, m√™me sans avoir de r√©gime particulier je conseille √† tous cette super combinaison de couleurs et de saveurs.
Nous reviendrons avec grand plaisir d√©couvrir le reste de cette carte."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,4,5,"C'√©tait les meilleurs sushis que je n'ai jamais mang√© ! Tr√®s √©labor√©, dans un cadre tr√®s sympathique. Parfait pour un d√Æner en t√™te √† t√™te."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Such a nice place to eat great and amazing food on Paris
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,This vegan sushi experience was outstanding. The mix of taste and flavour was amazing. The presentation of the dishes is very creative. REMARKABLE!!!!
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Best vegan sushi in Paris, all was delicious and the staff is super friendly!"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,5,5,4,"Salle joliment d√©cor√©e avec des mat√©riaux naturels, personnel souriant et plats originaux et savoureux."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Quality food, I loved the deco and the entire concept! I'll recommend it to my friends"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,4,5,"Les plats servis √©taient tr√®s bons, cela dit les gyozas √©taient froids lorsqu‚Äôils ont √©t√© servis √† table.
Le service √©tait rapide mais la serveuse qui s‚Äôoccupait de notre table s‚Äôest plaint de devoir calculer le montant de nos tickets restaurants."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,4,4,"Premi√®re visite r√©ussie. Les plats sont savoureux et originaux. Bons cocktails et carte des vins tr√®s correcte.
C√¥t√© salle, nous sommes arriv√©s √† 19h avec une faible fr√©quentation. Bien √©videmment le niveau sonore s'est √©lev√© au fil de la soir√©e mais c'est un peu normal. En tout cas, ce n'est pas un probl√®me.
Belle soir√©e et bonne adresse"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,5,4,4,"petit mais agr√©able, dommage que le sol et les tables soient collants, repas d√©licieux"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,3.0,3,4,3,2,"Concept int√©ressant, diversit√© de plats. 
Niveau sonore bien trop √©lev√©, tables rapproch√©es, intimit√© inexistante."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Tr√®s belle d√©couverte, des saveurs tr√®s bien ajust√©es, quel plaisir de remanger des sushis !"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,5,4,5,Une tr√®s belle d√©couverte. Tout a √©t√© tr√®s tr√®s bon et pour une facture sans exc√®s. Le seul l√©ger b√©mol c'est le fait de nous remettre l'addition sans l'avoir demand√© en nous annon√ßant que notre table est bient√¥t prise ... dommage de pas l'avoir su en amont et de se sentir press√©. Mais je recommande vraiment cette adresse
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing evening. I‚Äôd been wanting to go to bloom for a while but when it first opened it was always full, so not as easy to get a table. Now, a few months later, I was able to get a table by booking a week in advance. It was so worth the wait. The restaurant was quiet when we arrived, and even though as we were dining it got busier, the restaurant never got too loud. The food was, obviously, incredible! Everything we tried tasted so good. We‚Äôre already super excited to come back and eat there again."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,5,3,4,Je recommande ce restaurant avec des makis v√©g√©taux originaux et d√©licieux. Chouette cadre.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,5,5,"Bien le bonjour !

J'aime beaucoup votre restaurant pour sa cr√©ativit√©, la qualit√© de ses plats :p, son ambiance,  mais je trouve que certains point restent √† am√©lior√©:
-Les desserts ne sont pas assez fournis, cr√©atifs compar√©s au sal√© & pour certains pas vraiment ou pas assez dans la th√©matique japonaise.
-Alors je ne sais pas si c'est les √©pices, mais je trouve que certains makis limite trop sal√© si tremp√© dans la sauce soja. D'un cot√© c'est bien pour ceux qui n'aimes pas cette sauce de l'autre cela g√¢che l‚Äôexp√©rience.
Ce serait bien de le pr√©ciser dans le menu, ou de proposer une sauce moins charg√© en sel.

Voila sinon continuez comme √ßa c'est tr√®s bien et bient√¥t vous serez excellents :D.

Cordialement."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,We love this place! Great veggie sushi and excellent presentation from the chef. Staff is always attentive and friendly
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,3,4,"Interesting experience, but the food lacks the delicious simplicity of Japanese sushi. Too many conflicting tastes in one bite. But everything is fresh and nicely tempered ( top quality)"

Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Excellent !
Le lieu est decore avec soin.
Nous avons pris deux menus omakase et les jus de fruits frais. Les jus etaient delicieux et l'equilibre etait superbe, on sentait tous les ingredients et ils s'accordaient parfaitement.
Les edamames etaient tres bien prepares et la soupe miso etait tres goutue.
Les sushis sont originaux et vraiment bons ! C'est agreable de pouvoir manger des sushis vegetaliens recherches !
Le plus dur est de faire un choix sur la carte :)
Je recommande vivement cette adresse."

Soft drinks were okay. My party did not have any alcoholic drinks this time so no info on those.

Service was excellent. Very polite, very swift.

It's an expensive restaurant, but it's a very good one."

Unfortunately staff is chaotic but you can see they are trying their best!

30mins After placing order we were informed it wasn‚Äôt noted. After that no delay and good service 

There is a lot of potential - we will come again!"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Le paradis des Vegan. D√©licieux sushi vegan. Vari√©t√© des go√ªts et des textures. J‚Äô√©tais surprise par le go√ªt exquis. J‚Äôai m√™me senti qu‚Äôil y‚Äôavait du poisson dedans üòÜ
Excellents cocktails. Un r√©gal. Tr√®s qualitatif. Prix un peu √©lev√©.
Le lieu est magnifique et le service impeccable.
Le seul point n√©gatif: le saumon vegan n‚Äôa pas vraiment d‚Äôint√©r√™t"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,3.0,3,3,1,1,"Beaucoup de trop de couverts pour trop peu de place on mange compl√®tement coll√© √† ses voisins. Du coup difficile de faire le service, on vous tend les plats, pas du tout du niveau des prix pratiqu√©s‚Ä¶le soit disant caf√© gourmand n‚Äôest rien qu‚Äôun simple moelleux au chocolat de mauvaise facture. A 35‚Ç¨ le menu on s‚Äôattend √† autre chose!"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Thank you guys for this beautiful restaurant and yummy food. The decor is exquisite.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Very good food, nicely decorated, nice service! Compliments"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,We were shocked by hoe amazing this restaurant was. The attention and food was remarkable.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Plats tr√®s savoureux et diversifi√©s, belle pr√©sentation, lieu agr√©able et calme, service parfait !"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,4,4,"the service was very good. it was our first time there and we wanted to have a bit of guidance to discover the vegan sushis . the  advice given  was good maybe we had a little too much food  because the sushis are quite big and filling  but everything was delicious . Our order  came on the table very fast ,maybe a little fast ;)  we were overwhelmed with plates so forgot almost everything they explained , too many at a time . But we would come back again and order much less :)"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,3.0,3,2,4,4,"Tr√®s beau restaurant, belle promesse de sushis v√©g√©taux mais malheureusement le go√ªt n‚Äôy est pas pour ma part. Quand le l√©gume est √† l‚Äôhonneur il faut savoir le pr√©parer (enlever notamment la peau des poivrons), le cuire et l‚Äôassaisonner. Les associations de l√©gumes n‚Äô√©taient pas forc√©ment les meilleures √† mon avis. Je n‚Äôai pas forc√©ment retrouv√© le go√ªt de l‚Äôasie non plus - dommage pour un restaurant de sushis (meme v√©g√©taux).
Par contre, les gyozas sont tr√®s tr√®s bons."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Sushis vegan d√©licieux, nous avons ador√©.
Le personnel √©tait hyper sympa √©galement."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Un exp√©rience incroyable. Nous avons pass√© un d√©licieux moment, l'√©quipe est tr√®s professionnelle, agr√©able, de bon conseil. Les plats √©taient tous d√©licieux. Un grand merci ! et √† S√©bastien Kardinal √©galement !"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Tr√®s bon restaurant, les makis sont tou plus d√©licieux les uns que les autres.
A faire absolument."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,3.0,3,4,4,3,"Good portion, a lot of savour, maybe a little bit too much?
Rapid service and good wine and beer."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,2.0,2,5,1,1,"Nourriture excellente mais accueil d√©plorable. Arriv√©s √† 19h avec une r√©servation √† 19h15,on nous impose de nous asseoir en terrasse alors que nous sommes les premiers dans le restaurant. Une fois que le personnel a accept√© qu'on reste √† l'int√©rieur, on nous indique bien de lib√©rer la table avant 21h"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Exceptionnel, copieux et raffin√©. C'est une chance d'avoir enfin √† Paris un √©tablissement qui propose la cuisine de Christian Ventura !"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Magnifique !! Accueil ET repas.
J‚Äôy ai f√™t√© mon anniversaire et la responsable avait pr√©par√© un g√¢teau entier pour ma table avec un gla√ßage top et des bougies ! Une super ambiance et un go√ªt au top 
Nous nous sommes r√©gal√©es √† tous les points de vue."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,3,4,"Belle d√©couverte. 
Maki originaux, fins et travaill√©s.

Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Perfect place and delicious meals 
Wonderful moment"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Le sal√© est merveilleux: diversifi√©, cr√©atif, d√©licieux; vivement que j'y retourne go√ªter leurs autres cr√©ations.
Dommage que les d√©serts ne suivent pas encore, les mochis glac√©s sont tr√®s bons (pas trop sucr√©, ce qui est bien appr√©ciables), mais il n'y a pas ce cot√© cr√©atif, diversifi√©."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,4,4,"Truly experimental approach to vegan sushi delivers delicious tastes, surprising textures and splendid presentation. Good Sake too!"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,5,4,4,Outstanding sushi. Everything was crazy. The waiters were very nice. This restaurant is really amazing!
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Restaurant au top du top malgr√© qu'on soit un peu serr√© entre les tables mais la qualit√© de la nourriture, la qualit√© du service pour des prix tout √† fait abordables en valent vraiment le coup üòä Je recommande et j'y retournerai avec plaisir m√™me."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,3.0,3,4,2,3,"Les plats sont bons mais manque de textures 
Tout est mou dans la bouche, nous avions fait Momo √† Montr√©al il y a 3 ans, il y avait plus de croquant. 
Il y a un jeune serveur gar√ßon brun  qui doit avoir max 21 ans nous a pris de haut et nous a envoy√© balade car nous avons demand√© le code de la wifi et nous lui avons demand√© o√π √ßa en √©tait pour l‚Äôeau et le cocktail il nous a r√©pondu sur un mauvais ton.."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,4,5,It is very good restaurant !!! And the employees are very kind
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"D√©coration chaleureuse, c est d√©licieux raffin√© original le vin blanc est tr√®s bon et pas cher une bonne adresse pour faire du bien a son corps"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Tr√®s bonne adresse pour manger des sushis vegan mais prix trop √©lev√©s pour la quantit√© (10‚Ç¨ les 4, 10‚Ç¨ les 6) trop peu copieux"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Great evening 
Tables maybe a bit too close to each other"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Travel in Japan without the fish!! Perfect way to discover the divers way to prepare veggies
Bloom Sushi Wagram,3.0,3,2,1,4,"D√©√ßue par un service vraiment d√©cevant, soupe froide, cocktail servi avec le plat principal alors que nous les avions demand√© √† avoir le temps et les d√©guster avec l‚Äôentr√©e, nous avions demand√© une pause entre l‚Äôentr√©e et le plat, mais les plats se sont enchain√©s. Des plats aux saveurs riches mais trop complexes et parfois brouillonnes. Et surtout on se sent press√©es et c‚Äôest dommage."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellente soir√©e autour de plats bien pr√©sent√©s, originaux et d√©licieux"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,2.0,2,4,1,2,Not for d√Æner‚Ä¶ restaurant asked us firmly to live for the second service after one hour and a half at the table‚Ä¶..
Bloom Sushi Wagram,4.0,4,5,4,4,"Excellents sushis vegans avec beaucoup de saveurs √©tonnantes. 
Espace cependant un peu petit et certaines tables sont trop les unes sur les autres. Mais la nourriture vaut le d√©tour"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Nice place. Friendly service. Finally some pregnant woman friendly sushi. See you soon.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"2nd booking at Bloom, once again a great experience. Food is amazing, staff very friendly and atmosphere adequate for both personal and business occasions.
Looking forward to coming back to test new dishes ! vegan hazelnut cake highly recommended."

Encore merci, je reviendrai !"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Best sushi I've ever had.  Lovely staff. I still can't belive the salmon was vegan...incredible
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Cr√©atif, original, v√©g√©tal et d√©licieux
Bravo Bloom pour cette belle √©closion"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,2.0,2,2,1,3,"C'est un beau endroit, mais le service je n ai pas trouv√© tr√©s bon. 
J'ai pris le menu (soupe+guioza+sushis du chef). Ils ont oubli√© la soupe et ont apport√© directement la guioza. 
Ils ont bien expliqu√© √† table √† c√¥t√© comment fonctionnait le restaurant, mais pas pour moi (qui √©tait seul).
J'ai solicit√© une carrafe d'eau quand je suis arriv√©e, ils me l'ont apport√©e √† la fin. 
Les guiozas √©taient tr√®s bonne, mais je n'ai pas trop aim√© la s√©lection du menu car je trouvais qu'ils se ressemblaient beaucoup en termes de go√ªt.
Je n'ai pas r√©ussi √† tout manger, mais je n'ai pas pu apporter √† la maison car ils n'avaient pas de bo√Æte...
A la fin aussi je parlais de la soupe (qui n'√©tait pas venue), et pour ""resoudre"" , j'ai pris a nouveau les guiozas.
J'esp√®re qui c'√©tait juste une mauvaise journ√©e pour le restaurant...mon exp√©rience n'a pas comme j'attendais."
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent and unique vegan sushi in Paris. A must.
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,Chic et original . La carte est tr√®s compl√®te nous avons suivis les conseils pour notre commande .
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The best place for special occasion or just lunch or dinner in spacious and bright restaurant. All sushi rolls are fresh, hand rolled, keep their shape well and made with high quality ingredients. All staff is very friendly and helpful, they know the menu very well"
Bloom Sushi Wagram,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing experience: the food is delicious, very creative and flavourful. The staff is very friendly and service was speedy in spite of the almost full house. Congrats to the Bloom team! Can't wait to visit again."

L'Alsace,5.0,5,3,2,5,"En general la experiencia buena
No ten√≠a. La reserva hecha con la aplicaci√≥n pero nos encontraron sitio y pudimos sentarnos a comer
No nos entendimos en un plato que hab√≠amos pedido nos trajeron otro y se enfadaron pero al final fueron muy amable y se despiertan incluso llam√°ndome por mi nombre cosa que me gust√≥
En general bien y la ubicaci√≥n preciosa y el restaurante tambi√©n"
L'Alsace,5.0,5,5,4,5,very good experience & food.  Would come back again.
L'Alsace,5.0,5,5,4,4,"Great menu, service a bit hectic because it was so busy during holidays but lovely staff. Bathrooms need to be tended to more frequently. Overall a good experience."
L'Alsace,1.0,1,1,1,1,Absolutely terrible. Overwhelmed staff that couldn‚Äôt be bothered to give us any attention. Very low standards probably due to the fact that place is patronized almost exclusively by foreign tourists who don‚Äôt know any better. Appalling.
L'Alsace,1.0,1,1,1,1,"When we arrived, they told us they didn‚Äôt accept reservations. We showed them the reservation and they didn‚Äôt budge. Very rude."
L'Alsace,4.0,4,5,5,5,"They accommodated us fast, food was served quickly and it was fresh and hot. The waiter was nice and polite. Great location."
L'Alsace,1.0,1,1,2,3,"Really disappointed. The reviews and Instagram looked great but the food was over cooked, cold and lacked flavour. Very touristy. Very busy. The waiter was very nice but the food was a waste of money. I had lobster and fries and the fries were cold and the lobster was over cooked - almost like rubber. We just wanted to pay the bill and then leave. It was a waste of an evening which was a shame because I had such high hopes!"
L'Alsace,5.0,5,5,5,5,The waiter did his best to make us feel incredibly good.
L'Alsace,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent food and service! Will definitely return on our next trip to Paris!!
L'Alsace,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent would recommend to anyone wanting some classic French cuisine
L'Alsace,2.0,2,4,1,3,The food was fine. You can definitely find better at this price point. The service was horrible and incredibly rude.
L'Alsace,5.0,5,4,4,5,"Really enjoyed eating right on the Avenue des Champs-Elysees and the staff was very attentive and friendly.  Food was okay, not the greatest for the price, but worth it for the location."
L'Alsace,4.0,4,3,4,4,Enjoyable atmosphere and good value for money. Service very good
L'Alsace,3.0,3,3,4,4,"Food was functional, nothing more.  Location on Champs-Elyse‚Äôs was a plus for convenience and people watching."
L'Alsace,1.0,1,1,2,2,"I would NOT recommend eating here. It's like eating in times square in New York City - overpriced, lacking service and generally poor food. I hope that visitors to Paris do not this that this is typical of Parisian food or even good food - it's barely mediocre American food although they cater to a large American tourist base as seen even in the portion sizes."
L'Alsace,4.0,4,4,4,5,Had a lovely experience with very good food but‚Ä¶the mattress d‚Äô did not have our reservation and said they do not accept Open Table reservations because Open Table never communicates the reservation to them. We were graciously seated nevertheless. I had salmon which was delicious and my husband had lamb which was good. They paired nicely with an Alsatian Pinot Noir which waitstaff recommended. We finished it off by sharing an Alsace Sundae. We would recommend this restaurant.
L'Alsace,5.0,5,4,5,5,Best service we had while in Paris! The beef fondant with spetzle was delicious and tender!
L'Alsace,3.0,3,3,3,4,I booked a table through open table. When we arrived they had no booking in my name. Fortunately the could fit us in. I booked and confirmed through the app. We had only gone to Paris for the day. We could have been left with nowhere to eat.
L'Alsace,5.0,5,5,5,5,Espectacular!!
L'Alsace,1.0,1,3,3,3,"We had booked through OpenTable but they did not have our booking.  Even showing them the booking confirmation on the app did not convince them.  After much discussion we managed to get a table for 4 (we were 5), not great"
L'Alsace,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Arrived during an unexpected wind and deluge of rain, so many people caught out trying to find a table.
Having booked we were ushered through the madding throng and offered a quiet table in the corner. We were very well looked after.
Quite difficult to find in Paris restaurants, but have always loved choucroute aux poissons. Didn‚Äôt disappoint."
L'Alsace,1.0,1,1,3,1,"p√©sima la comida, un calor insoportable, no prenden el aire acondicionado, caro pero malo."
L'Alsace,1.0,1,2,2,2,"Dishes were dirty, busser did not care. Food was price for the quality."
L'Alsace,2.0,2,2,1,3,"The service was very slow. One of the servers towards the end got really angry at us after asking multiple times for a spook for our desert that sat out for 10 minutes. 
Typical tourist spot."
L'Alsace,2.0,2,1,1,3,"Overall experience below expectations as food quality was lacking (except Foie Gras) and service very sloppy. Ordered the Duck Confit which was dry and old. Head Waiter said that it is the way it is served. I have eaten Duck Confit in many restaurants across many countries but never such a poor version. 
Overall this seems just another Parisian restaurante on Champs Elysees that is tired of serving tourists. Asked for the Manager but he was busy! What a shame as the place is nice."
L'Alsace,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wonderful dinner and desserts.
L'Alsace,4.0,4,5,5,5,"Je regrette le manque de climatisation par une temp√©rature de 30 degr√©s..
Samedi 18 juin 2022‚Ä¶ 3 couverts √† 22H
Ma femme √©tait tr√®s mal √† l‚Äôaise..
Merci"
L'Alsace,4.0,4,4,3,4,"La reserva no aparec√≠a en el libro de reservas, finalmente solucionaron montando una mesa, no obstante es muy inc√≥modo llegar y que ocurra esto‚Ä¶.."
L'Alsace,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Good dinner experience for my wife‚Äôs birthday. Food and service were both great.
Only downside is my wife‚Äôs desert was not available because they ran out ‚Ä¶ we ate at 7:30pm and restaurant closes at 4am ‚Ä¶ how do you run out of cr√™pes flamb√©e? Had to finish our dinner at the upscale restaurant up the street ‚Ä¶ feels like a missed opportunity."
L'Alsace,3.0,3,3,4,4,"It's a nice restaurant that has a great location on the Champs E'lysees, but of course, you're going to pay for it. We started our night with 6 oysters and chose the waiter's recommendation of the oysters that weren't too salty. Wow, I'm glad we didn't take the ones he said were salty. These were extremely salty and didn't come with any sort of sauce to help moderate the saltiness, just a lemon.  For the main course, I had a filet mignon and my wife had mussels. She enjoyed the very generous portion of mussels but wish they would have come with a side dish as well. My steak was disappointing to say the least. It was extremely overcooked and was the toughest filet I've ever had in my life. And for 37 euros, it should have come with more than just french fries. A vegetable would have been nice.

There are so many better restaurants in Paris, I'd pass on this one and find something a bit more off the beaten path."
L'Alsace,3.0,3,2,4,3,"Location and ambience are perfect, the service and wine perfectly good‚Ä¶ but the food, given this is dining in Paris, is very poor.  Overcooked and dry are the positives."
L'Alsace,4.0,4,4,4,5,"Beautiful yet informal setting, great food at affordable prices, fantastic location, efficient service- best choice in Paris"
L'Alsace,4.0,4,4,5,5,Very good service
L'Alsace,5.0,5,5,5,5,Comida de negocios
L'Alsace,5.0,5,5,5,5,Prompt service and delicious food!
LES PI√âTONS,3.0,3,4,4,3,"Cela fait des ann√©es que nous fr√©quentons cet √©tablissement et nous avons pass√© des soir√©es m√©morables Grace aux anciennes √©quipes.
L‚Äôambiance a chang√©e et est devenue plus ¬´¬†lisse¬†¬ª. Le mojito est moins bon qu‚Äôavant. Les tapas sont toujours de bonne qualit√© et le personnel serviable"
LES PI√âTONS,1.0,1,2,1,2,Terrible service from the hostess. She was rude. Forgotten about our table. Given a table stuck on the end with no room. Waited 50 mins for our food to be brought out. Asked to leave as soon as we finished our meal. Waited 20 mins for the bill. So disappointing.
LES PI√âTONS,3.0,3,3,3,3,"La sangria n‚Äô√©tait pas terrible, beaucoup d‚Äôeau‚Ä¶
Les plats ne sont pas trop mal mais manquaient de sel. Le plus d√©cevant c‚Äôest que cela fait cher par rapport aux quantit√©s‚Ä¶"
Restaurant Assanabel R√©publique - Cuisine libanaise,5.0,5,5,5,5,"This is actually for the location on Rue Jacob.  We mistakenly reserved at the wrong location.  No matter, I‚Äôm sure the food is every bit as excellent.  The host graciously made room for us.  Service was above and beyond.  The server did a great job in guiding us with food and wine selections.  Can‚Äôt recommend enough."
Restaurant Assanabel R√©publique - Cuisine libanaise,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Food: fantastic, lamb is absolutely the must try. They serve good wine!

Service: family owned restaurant, very friendly and show the hospitality

Language: English avaliable which is so much supportive to the tourists who cannot speak French.

Others: mint tea was served with fresh munt which is very very nice and authentic. Dry mint tea bag is definitely unacceptable!

Recommended!"
Restaurant Assanabel R√©publique - Cuisine libanaise,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Really warm and friendly, and good food. As a group of five, we opted for the 14 shared plates. Would have liked a bit more selection for the vegan/vegetarian side on the hot menu but overall it was lovely"
Restaurant Assanabel R√©publique - Cuisine libanaise,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Tr√®s satisfaite je recommande
Tr√®s bonne nourriture"
Restaurant Assanabel R√©publique - Cuisine libanaise,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food was wonderfully authentic and delicious‚ÄîThe service was fast and friendly.  We were full so we took the fabulous baklava assortment to go and enjoyed it at home with coffee:)!  We WILL be back!!
Restaurant Assanabel R√©publique - Cuisine libanaise,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Restaurant tr√®s sympathique, super service et excellente nourriture. Je recommande vivement !"
Restaurant Assanabel R√©publique - Cuisine libanaise,4.0,4,5,3,3,Super nice & delicious food. Overwhelmed waiters.
Restaurant Assanabel R√©publique - Cuisine libanaise,2.0,2,2,1,4,"Service was slow, and food was average, not what I expected from the reviews of others. However, the staff were friendly, and kind which made up for the experience."
Restaurant Assanabel R√©publique - Cuisine libanaise,3.0,3,3,2,3,The restaurant was understaffed so service was slow and waiter forgot 2 meals out of 9 so that was awkward. Food itself was good quality. Felt sorry for the 1 waiter who was running around all tables and clearly not coping.
Restaurant Assanabel R√©publique - Cuisine libanaise,3.0,3,3,3,3,"√âquipe sympathique

Restaurant Assanabel R√©publique - Cuisine libanaise,5.0,5,4,5,5,"A very good Lebanese restaurant, Very kind people and service."
Restaurant Assanabel R√©publique - Cuisine libanaise,2.0,2,2,4,3,"Definitely not a 5-star experience.
We tried the mezzeh for 2 and every dish we got was just acceptable. We were also surprised to get a cold pita bread and usually in great Lebanese restaurants the pita bread is freshly out of the oven to the table.
The service was great and was the only thing that saved the night, however the servers should try and smile more; their stiff approach is a bit unwelcoming.
The head server was no where to be seen in the floor as we would have loved giving him/ her this feedback in person."
Restaurant Assanabel R√©publique - Cuisine libanaise,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Everything was perfect, every detail considered!

The host and waitstaff were attentive, abs the dishes they recommended were absolutely delicious

Highly recommend"
Restaurant Assanabel R√©publique - Cuisine libanaise,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Fantastic fresh food, attentive service and quick - without being rushed!"
Bustronome Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"What a fun night.  Driving along streets of Paris while drinking good wine and gourmet food.  Thought it would be touristy, but it was not.  It was all class."
Bustronome Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,I was a bit special when I booked the reservation but the food and wine parings were amazing.    The service was great and the views from the top deck are great.    Would do this again in a heartbeat.   They also run the same program in London
Bustronome Paris,4.0,4,5,5,5,"The food was impeccable and staff/service friendly and prompt.
Sadly the a/c on our bus was faulty and in 30¬∞ heat we sweated buckets! After the initial discomfort, we had a good laugh with the staff who made an extra stop to help recovery and offered complementary drinks.
The whole night was amazing and we highly recommend for a short visit in Paris."
Bustronome Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"To anyone who is visiting Paris and does not have a lot of time to do fine dining and a tour you get both here. We visited over 7 attractions in Paris and the last stop at the Eiffel tower was the absolute best. We were served small portions of a 5 course meal, which initially looked small however it was filling and delicious"
Bustronome Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Initially skeptical, but we had a wonderful tour of Paris gliding through the boulevards enjoying a wonderful meal and concluded with fireworks at the Eiffel Tower for Bastille Day!"
Bustronome Paris,5.0,5,4,4,5,Bellissimo il tour di Parigi
Bustronome Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,Awesome!! I totally recommend this experience.  The food was great and the wine pairings were perfect.
Inavou√©,4.0,4,4,3,3,"Sch√∂nes kleines Fusion Restaurant, dass eine gem√ºtliche Atmosph√§re schafft."
Inavou√©,3.0,3,2,5,4,"Das vegetarische Silvestermenue war sehr lecker, bei dem Menue 1 war das rohe Fleisch nicht d√ºnn genug geschnitten und der Lachs roch und schmeckte nicht ganz frisch. Der Preis war pro Person,  die Portionen leider ohne vorherige Beschreibung f√ºr 2 Personen, somit leider nur ein teurer Snack, aber nicht ein ausreichendes Essen f√ºr 2. Warum werden 3 Gambos f√ºr 2 Personen serviert??? Trotz Reservierung sa√üen wir an der ge√∂ffneten Durchgangst√ºr an Tischen und St√ºhlen von drau√üen, es war leider etwas k√ºhl/zugig. F√ºr das ganze Lokal gibt es wirklich nur eine (!) einzige Toilette, nichtproGeschlecht. Das Personal war super freundlich und ist geflitzt,  eine weitere Kraft f√ºr diesen Abend h√§tte aber auch f√ºr die G√§ste entspannend sein k√∂nnen."
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,3,5,We visited on NYE and the food was excellent! Small plates. Service was so but I think to be expected in Paris on NYE. We were happily eating and visiting for 3 hours. Highly recommend
Inavou√©,4.0,4,5,5,5,"Locale accogliente, personale gentile ed efficiente"
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,4,5,"What a delight. This is a ‚Äúsmall plates‚Äù restaurant. We had 4 small plates for the two of us plus dessert. The price was one third less than the cafe where we dined the evening before. The atmosphere is inventive and quirky. The other diners were all French, so the locals must like it. Highly recommended."
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,4,"The food is great. Brunch 29‚Ç¨ =  1 viennoiserie + 1 fresh juce + 1 hot drink + 1 salted plate (numerous choices from bagel to eggs omelettes) + 1 sweet plate (also numeroux choices from sunday with toppings to pancakes with chantilly).

The products are good. The plates looks delicious, the team is very nice and polite. I would recommand definitly. The areal is literally posh and it is a bonus. 

Not really noisy inside. We haven't try the veranda."
Inavou√©,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Nice restaurant. Good food. Many vegetarian options.
Excellent service!"
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Sublime - total hidden gem and the service was excellent. Location is terrific
Inavou√©,4.0,4,5,4,4,"El lugar es agradable, la atenci√≥n no es regular solo hay dos meseros y no cubren muy bien la atenci√≥n de todas las mesas, la variedad del men√∫ es muy limitada hay pocas opciones pero todo es de muy buen sabor, las porciones son peque√±as una no es suficiente"
Inavou√©,1.0,1,2,1,1,"We walked in on a hot evening with reservations and there were several tables for four open outside, but despite repeatedly politely asking to sit outside, they said they couldn‚Äôt seat groups of 3 at tables for 4. They then seated us at a table for 5 inside, the literal only table seated inside, right next to the bathroom. Because literally every other guest was outside, we were extremely easy for them to ignore. We asked for water 3 times and never received it. It was hot. Very bad."
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wonderful food and beautiful secluded location at the end of a street! Highly recommend!
Inavou√©,4.0,4,5,4,4,"On venait pour un repas, il n'y avait qu'un brunch mais de qualit√© et dans un cadre sympatique."
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great meal, great service. Thank you!"
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great food and customer service
Cute area as well and can walk around to other restaurants after for drinks"
Inavou√©,3.0,3,2,4,4,"For me, a very confused menu. It‚Äôs gimmicky, a mix of East Asian and French, and truffle pasta? It‚Äôs a menu that denotes a lack of confidence in the dishes. The food came alarmingly quickly, which is always a bad sign. The gyozas tasted reheated, the teriyaki beef was sort of like warm, and the beef wrapped around cheese was a bit strange and just not very nice quality. The Korean fried chicken was ok. The staff were very pleasant and accommodating, and we liked the decor. But would not return."
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Such a fun place with excellent food and great friendly service. We went here with our older teenagers and had a great evening. Meat and veggie menus. A real find in Paris.

Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,I booked a table for my birthday and we had the special menu for two. It was a lovely menu with different little plates tapas style and every dish was delicious. The ambiance was so relaxing and the seats so comfortable. I would go back any day.
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Sehr freundliches und zuvorkommendes Personal!
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,The decor and food was absolutely amazing. I loved the play on words that they used for the menus and cocktails. The prefix menu was a genius idea especially if you are being indecisive and want to try a little bit of everything. The portion sizes are like tapas. I will definitely visit them again when and if I return to Paris.
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,2,5,Staff was friendly

Inavou√©,2.0,2,2,1,4,"Really slow waiters. Our waiter managed to spill drinks (plural) over our company, got a custom shot as compensation. Had to ask for the bill several times, and got then presented with a different tables bill."

Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,The food and service were excellent!
Inavou√©,4.0,4,5,5,4,I had several friends that enjoy this restaurant and recommended dining there. I was pleasantly surprised and the dining experience exceeded my expectations! The food is very good and service is excellent. The signature cocktails are also very good. I will recommend this restaurant to anyone traveling to Paris wanting French cuisine with a modern twist!
Inavou√©,2.0,2,1,5,4,"The Korean fried chicken is fried curry chicken, under cooked and bland. The cod croquettes were mush. My martini was basically just fruit juice."
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Outstanding food, good service, excellent value. A gem. Highly recommended."
Inavou√©,4.0,4,4,4,4,"A melting pot of flavours! The service was efficient and friendly, the ambience relaxed."
Inavou√©,4.0,4,5,5,4,The food is phenomenal  I highly recommend it. My one negative is people smoke right beside you. That is troublesome for people with breathing problems. The service and staff were efficient and friendly. I would visit again.
Inavou√©,4.0,4,4,3,4,Cool atmosphere.  Great dishes for sharing.
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,I spent a week in Paris and I must say this is the best place we have eaten at in the city.

Inavou√©,3.0,3,3,3,3,Great place with tapas-style dishes. The recommended 3 dishes per person is accurate - even for people with a healthy appetite.
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Fantastic place. Food was lovely and staff were friendly. As a vegan I found plenty of options. The cauliflower dish was so tasty (minus the sauce as it has mayo in it which is not vegan) We got seated inside as it looked like it might rain and I‚Äôm so glad as it was lovely ambiance inside and great music.
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,4,Tucked away at the end of a row of restaurants Inavou√© was a great experience.  The server was attentive and thorough. We shared 3 starters and two mains.  The torched cauliflower was the favorite.  The dumplings and the fried chicken were also delicious.  Do t forget the Pornstar martini.  Overall wonderful evening.
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Got seated quickly.Restaurant was very nice. Excellent waiter and good.
Inavou√©,3.0,3,3,3,4,"Nice food, slow service. Very tiny restaurant, people smoking around."
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great restaurant with great cuisine. All the food comes to the table to share and is so delicious. Excellent quality and preparation. The organic ros√© was delicious and well tempered. The service was very nice. We had reserved a table outside. When we arrived, everything was occupied and a table was quickly brought in for us."
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,3,5,"Loved the atmosphere and the food was absolutely amazing!! Really delicious. Service was a bit slower but nothing too crazy, and unless you‚Äôre in a rush, it‚Äôs totally fine. Really recommend this place"
Inavou√©,4.0,4,5,2,5,"We went to dinner with our three children. The place is great, it was full, so probably that was the reason for the poor service. We waited 15 minutes after we were seated for someone to approach our table. But the food was excellent. EVERYTHING! Finished with an incredible tiramis√∫."
Inavou√©,4.0,4,4,3,4,Food was good but it took quite a long time to arrive.
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,4,5,Food was delicious! Very unique! Very hip and energetic restaurant! Definitely recommend!
Inavou√©,4.0,4,4,3,4,"We are a family of four that likes to share plates.  This was a perfect menu for us with a number of small plates that appealed to us.  All the food items were good, nothing particularly spectacular although the truffle pasta was a highlight for our kids.  Nice atmosphere as a cafe in a quiet setting.  We enjoyed it."
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,We were on our honeymoon and this was our first dinner in Paris. It was absolutely delicious there wasn‚Äôt anything we didn‚Äôt like. The vibe was so cute and chic. Highly highly recommend!!
Inavou√©,4.0,4,4,4,4,"The cocktails were amazing!
The place was very cute
The menu was quirky and whilst it didn't have lots of options, we really enjoyed the dishes we ordered, they had a mezze brunch plate which was tasty and filling.
The toilets weren't great
We would certainly go back"
Inavou√©,1.0,1,4,1,3,"Der Service wirkte an diesem Abend sehr √ºberfordert. Unsere Bestellungen wurden nur nach sehr langem Warten entgegen genommen. Nachdem wir fertig waren, wurden wir nicht gefragt, ob wir noch etwas trinken wollen. Wir mussten uns aktiv darum bem√ºhen und nochmal nach der Karte fragen. Bestellen konnten wir dann nichts mehr, da leider kein Kellner in der N√§he war. Als wir nach der Rechnung gefragt haben, mussten wir nochmal fast 15 Minuten warten bis wir bezahlen konnten. Obendrein wurde unsere Reservierung √ºber OpenTable als ‚Äûnicht wahrgenommen‚Äú vermerkt, obwohl wir dort waren."
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"One translation of the restaurant's name would be ""hidden.""   And it is a bit out of the way.  But it offers good eclectic small dishes at a very reasonable price. It is a tapas restaurant, but not necessarily confined to Spanish tapas.  The meal was tasty, sufficient in quantity, and imaginative, assembling dishes from different culinary traditions. And we could always order more plates in mid meal. The wine was, for Paris, very fairly priced.  And the service was both correct and friendly. A nice find."
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,3,5,"Great small plates, wonderful ambiance. Service was slow but that‚Äôs alright, as we were in no rush."

Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Fantastic restaurant. The staff was attentive, and the food and cocktails excellent. Our group of six tried almost every small plate on the menu, and we loved each one. As a Celiac (gluten-free), I appreciated that the majority of the menu was gluten-free, although I didn‚Äôt inquire too much about kitchen cross-contamination."

Inavou√©,1.0,1,2,1,1,La mani√®re dont nous avons √©t√© accueillis et servis √©tait just inadmissible. Notre serveur √©tait clairement homophobe et a tout fait pour que nous quittions les lieux sans tarder. Nous n‚Äôaurons donc pris qu‚Äôune entr√©e.

Inavou√©,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Lindo lugar en preciosa zona, un brunch en Paris estilo newyorquino"
Inavou√©,2.0,2,1,1,2,"It was like walking out of a movie theater because the movie was **that atrocious**. We literally had to bail after appetizers. 

This restaurant barely gets 2 stars overall due to reservation booking mishap (opentable‚Äôs fault?), frankly horrendous food, and the flippantly dismissive attitude of the staff (and I totally understand restaurant service in Paris is different than in the US). Ambiance inside the restaurant is kitschy-swanky-cozy, so I‚Äôll give them that. 

I made a reservation three weeks in advance for a casual, romantic dinner with my sweetheart for 6:00pm on a Wednesday. Reservation was confirmed for 6pm, online menu looked beyond delicious, we were excited. Open table included instructions that our reservation would be forfeited if we were more than 15 minutes late. With that said, we arrived a few minutes early. 

We walked up to the restaurant and spotted only one guy around lounging on one of the outdoor banquettes. He literally could not be bothered to make eye contact with us because swiping right and left on his phone was more enticing than doing his job. 

‚ÄúWhat you want me to do? No one in the kitchen until 19:00‚Äù (sans eye contact) was the only explanation we received at all about our 18:00 reservation (6:00pm). So we waited . . .for well over an hour . . . We upheld our end of the reservation by showing up on time, the restaurant didn‚Äôt do the same. 

Fast forward to after the lounger/phone swiper/waiter? could be bothered to take our dinner order . . . the appetizers were awful by EPIC proportions. 

We ordered two appetizers, because frankly we were hungry after that hour wait: 

1.a crawfish appetizer that may have contained crawfish, but I can‚Äôt confirm. It was just a soggy, sad mess. 

2. The other appetizer we ordered were chicken tenders that were overcooked in a ‚Äúis this someone‚Äôs pinky finger?‚Äù sort of way. After ANOTHER 30 minutes, my husband checked on the entree we ordered, and guess what? Yep, still not sent to the kitchen."
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,4,5,Great experience & Amazing food. The staff are very nice and the atmosphere is lovely. Would come again.
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Tout a √©t√© tr√®s bien

Inavou√©,4.0,4,5,5,5,"The staff were really nice and the food was fantastic! My only critic was that the entrance was a little hard to find because they had some curtains down, otherwise all was perfect."
Inavou√©,4.0,4,4,4,5,"Our first dinner in Paris, the place have an amazing atmosphere, quietly, beautiful and romantic.
The plates we ordered was very good in flavors, form and have good quantity.
The only thing could be better in my opinion is about the Wines, the options offered in the menu were so expensive."
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great food and service.
Inavou√©,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Really nice service, cool atmosphere and whilst food is not to die for it is well thought and great value for money

Inavou√©,4.0,4,3,5,5,"The staff here are friendly and knowledgeable and speak English really well. The decor is lovely and it‚Äôs very calm, quite quiet and the atmosphere is nice. The food is good and tasty but unfortunately nothing special. It‚Äôs much better than many of the tourist trap traditional French restaurants"
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing host, Fantastic Food.

Will definitely be recommending to others"
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,We had the most amazing waiter and meal at inavou√©. Would highly recommend to all!
Inavou√©,4.0,4,5,5,4,The restaurant is at the end of a small row of restaurants. The servers are attentive and prices reasonable. The menu is short but everything tasted good.
Inavou√©,3.0,3,2,4,5,"It‚Äôs advertised as a French restaurant but the food is very Asian styled. We ordered the steak which was tasting more like a Mongolian/Chinese beef. The Cesar salad, the sauce wasn‚Äôt right and the chicken was Asian style breaded.
Overall taste was ok but was very different than our expectations and the menu descriptions."
Inavou√©,2.0,2,2,3,4,"This restaurant was so beautiful and inviting, but the food just wasn't right. Their english menus had poor translations so it was hard to understand fully what the dishes were even with an explanation from the waitress. 

What we did end up ordering did not come out as expected and didn't taste good. The burrata with asparagus was served in a ball without proper oil dressing and on top of a hard tomato with no asparagus whatsoever. The tuna tartare was asian styled with a giant salad on top and green beans on the side instead of one combined dish. In all, the food execution was just not there."
Inavou√©,4.0,4,4,5,5,Very good!
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Fantastic food .. great atmosphere.. very attentive staff
Inavou√©,3.0,3,4,2,3,One waiter‚Äîhe was working hard but struggled to keep up.  Food was good.

Inavou√©,1.0,1,1,2,4,"Understaffed, food was abysmal."
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,Wonderful and lovely Place in the middle of Paris. Great Service and excellent food. Mixture of modern Parisian Cousine and influences from all over the world.
Inavou√©,5.0,5,4,5,4,Very friendly service. Nice location. We dined first inside and went outside for deserts and drinks. It is worth to try. Good food.
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Loved Inavoue Restaurant
Delicious food, very romantic setting and charming waitstaff."
Inavou√©,1.0,1,1,2,2,"This restaurant looked quite good online, but was a huge disappointment. I have a restaurant background and generally don‚Äôt post negative reviews, however for the prices they are charging I feel others should have the heads up as to what caliber experience they can expect here. We split a tuna tartare to start, which included rice crispies (ie puffed rice). This is the first time ever I have come across the use of rice crispies in a recipe at a restaurant. The tartare was also unusually sweet. I typically don‚Äôt send things back, but this was priced I believe at 24 euro and was pretty bizarre. For main courses, my friend ordered the lamb, which was underwhelming at best. I ordered the lobster roll that was described as coming with chips. I expected this would be of the French fry variety, however they were actually potato chips. As a side note, washrooms and overall cleanliness was also not great. Posting pics of the previously mentioned tuna tartare and lobster roll. Spend your money elsewhere, this is crazy overpriced and would not even be of basic pub level quality, so if you‚Äôre looking for something special this is not it."
Inavou√©,5.0,5,4,5,4,"Great food, great service, off the beaten track. Would recommend trying the 'secret' cocktail! We were there two weeks ago to celebrate our anniversary - the outdoor area is nicely decorated, cosy and romantic. Loved the atmosphere and friendly service!"
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We was here for my fiance Birthday on Saturday evening. Such a very beautiful place !!! 
Service by Marion was superb and the ambiance lovely. Perfect restaurant for a date."
Inavou√©,1.0,1,1,1,3,Long gaps between waiter checks.  The food was NOTHING as it was described.  Nothing special at all. The fish was the boniest y have ever had.
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Beautiful restaurant on an out of the way side street with a true Parisian vibe. Live greenery creates a lush backdrop to outdoor, covered dining. Inside, intimate tables and eclectic decor enhance your dining experience - candles burn brightly on each table from whimsical quail candleholders. Enough about the look of the place - the food was fabulous! We had the marinated beef and the turbot after a wonderful appetizer of avocados, mangos, and crawfish. The beef was cut with a fork tender and melted in your mouth. The sauce was amazing. The fish was tender and perfectly cooked. Again, the sauce was brilliant. The owners are young and happy - speaking several languages including English and French. Don‚Äôt miss out on this neighborhood gem when you are in Paris - Inavou√© won‚Äôt leave you undeclared - you‚Äôll give it 5 stars, too!"
Inavou√©,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Cozy and intimate restaurant in the heart of Paris; ideal for dinner or drinks. There are only a handful of interesting restaurants near Place Du March√© Saint-Honor√©, and Inavou√© is a place you‚Äôll find yourself always going back to. Lots of healthy cuisine. Not to mention, it is also perfectly hidden from all the other restaurants in the area."

Kani Grill,5.0,5,4,5,4,From the time we entered the building we were made very welcome and were looked after excellently. The food was to a high standard and was very enjoyable. Drinks were reasonably priced as were the meals themselves. Staff looked after our every need especially as it was a very busy evening being New Year's Eve. We would certainly recommend this for anyone to pay a visit too as we had a lovely time without being rushed to end our meal.
Kani Grill,5.0,5,5,5,5,Ricardo (I think that was his name was fantastic. Staff was very friendly and the price was great. Definitely going back.

Kani Grill,2.0,2,2,3,2,The waiters don‚Äôt understand english. Looked very weird while doing our order. Example: ordered the chocolate lava cake (thats on the menu) and he told me the price is for 2? I did not know what he meant. Later i only received 2 balls of chocolate ice cream. It was a very weird experience.

Au Pavillon Paris,1.0,1,1,1,5,"They refused to serve us although we had a confirmed reservation and we arrived before our reservation time. We were visiting Paris and were not aware of the other open restaurants in the area that provided late night dining. Because we took a taxi to the restaurant, we had to walk around to find food to avoid another expensive taxi."
Au Pavillon Paris,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Being from America, I tried to read reviews before selecting a restaurant to make sure we could enjoy the experience.

Not the experience we wanted in Paris for Christmas."
Au Pavillon Paris,3.0,3,4,4,5,Reported me as 'no show'. Had to prove attendance with information from the check.  No excuse from the restaurant.
Au Pavillon Paris,5.0,5,5,4,5,"As an American in France I‚Äôm usually disappointed by the supreme lack of attentiveness in a waiter or waitress, but our waitress made the whole meal excellent. There was the right combination of letting us enjoy the food and the restaurant as well as giving to American demands for attention (and some bits of English). Not to mention the food was ridiculously good. This is an excellent spot for a casual upscale dinner or a good place to hang out for happy hour."
Au Pavillon Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Unfortunately after we rode halfway around Paris to get to our scheduled reservation, when we arrived the restaurant was closed before their announced closing time. They just said to us that they were sorry and refuse to tell us where else to go to have dinner.  #badtimes"

Pompette,4.0,4,5,4,4,We had a great evening at Pompette. The food was amazing and the steak with chimichurri sauce was delicious.
Pompette,3.0,3,3,5,5,"Great service, food lacked taste and some items were cold (some items), the best thing was the pasta. Again, servers were super nice."
Pompette,4.0,4,5,5,4,We had a fantastic time.  The Tapas and wine was delicious.   We particularly like the eggs and the ricotta with peas.
Pompette,5.0,5,5,5,4,Service chaleureux et de qualit√©. Les petites assiettes √† partager sont sublimes. C est un restaurant de quartier √† d√©couvrir absolument.
Pompette,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great food, amazing experience and ambiance. Intimate dining with quality service and plate creations that are sure to leave you impressed and happy with your restaurant choice for the evening."
Ambia restaurant,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We had a fantastic experience on New Years Eve, thanks to the incredibly friendly owner. He helped us choose delicious dishes, perfect for both adults and kids. The kids loved the chicken dish and were delighted with the chocolate and mango lassi. The naan bread and shrimp curry were outstanding. The owner's warmth and ability to assist us in English made our visit especially enjoyable. It's a great spot for families and groups, offering a cozy atmosphere and genuinely great hospitality. Highly recommend for authentic Indian cuisine and a welcoming experience."
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Service super sowie Essen und die Drinks. Die Preise sind gehoben .
Das Restaurant wandelt sich ab 0:00 Uhr in eine Bar mit Musik um. Man bekommt immer noch Essen und kann sich wunderbar am√ºsieren.
Personal super freundlich und sie k√∂nnen auf Englisch sprechen
Vielen Dank üëåüèº"
Le Magnifique,4.0,4,4,3,3,"We enjoyed our dinner, service could have been better but the food and ambience was great!"
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We loved this restaurant! It is amazing for service, atmosphere, along with the quality of the food and drink! It is more than just a dinner out, it is an experience! When we are next in Paris we will definitely go here again!"
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I cannot say enough about this restaurant, the food, the service‚Ä¶.EVERYTHING was exceptional!   This was not planned and we ended up here bc OpenTable suggested it.  The BEST experience and food we had in Paris.
Get the French Toast for dessert.
Our waitress was the best.  The manager was so friendly and checked on us repeatedly.

If I could give it 10 stars I would!"
Le Magnifique,4.0,4,5,5,4,"Made our reservation early but had to add 6 more, which we did. Arrived at 8 pm, only to be told that they didn‚Äôt open until 8:30 and they only showed 6 people. Got it straightened out and we were seated on the sidewalk, which was a bit loud but a lovely night. Ordered drinks and appetizers, which were great. Everyone‚Äôs main meal was delicious. Service was fantastic and we celebrated our friends 50th anniversary in style. Great menu and good for a big table if you sit outside. Inside is small and dark."
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,A restaurant full of character.  Food excellent.  Good atmosphere. Easy walk to Arc de Triomphe.  Inside nice for winter.
Le Magnifique,4.0,4,2,4,4,"Beautifully ascetic restaurant. Would be perfect for very late night dinners but the food quality did not quite match up to the surroundings. I would recommend booking for drinks or late night eats though! Food is served until 4 am, it‚Äôs very much like a cool members club. Think Annabelle‚Äôs in London."
Le Magnifique,4.0,4,5,5,3,"It was perfect until a family arrived‚Ä¶.to a very adult restaurant,  with a child who had his IPad on with a loud show or game on  and no one asked him to use head phones or turn it down. Absolutely ruined the vibe! Rude and very disrespectful to all the other diners.

Food was fabulous!"
Le Magnifique,1.0,1,1,1,1,Booked through open table dressed up went to the restaurant and it was closed very disappointed
Le Magnifique,1.0,1,1,1,1,We got there & it was closed! After receiving notification of our booking & confirmation requests we were attending.
Le Magnifique,1.0,1,1,1,1,"This was our only reserved dinner night while in Paris and we were looking forward to a nice dinner. We made the reservation, confirmed, got ready, aligned our plans in Paris around our reserved time. We showed up early and the restaurant was closed. We waited until we‚Äôll after our reservation time and the place was still closed. We watched other people show up dressed very nicely for a nice dinner experience the same thing. We were very disappointed. If they were closed, why was our reservation confirmed. We could have made other plans."
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,Delicious food and friendly staff. It was my fianc√©‚Äôs birthday and they were very accomodating. The decor and ambiance is amazing as well.
Le Magnifique,4.0,4,4,4,3,"We were only ones inside restaurant..

Food was exceptional ..

Only feedback it was a pre - anniversary meal no gratit. offer, but friendly staff .."
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We had a memorable and fantastic dinner here on our first night in Paris.  There is so much good food in this city but our meal at Le Manifique really stood out.  The cocktails were superb, my scallops were some of the best I've ever tasted and the tuna my wife had crusted with sesame seeds was wonderful.  But the French toast dessert was to die for and probably ruined french toast for us forever as it will be hard to beat.  All of this was served in a sexy fun atmosphere with the waiter dj'ing some fantastic Motown through 90s soft hip hop classics.  Overall this was our favorite dinner in Paris and I'd highly recommend!"
Le Magnifique,1.0,1,1,1,1,We could not review properly as we arrived and the restaurant was closed due to trouble in Paris. We were not informed so travelled across Paris to find the restaurant locked up with no one answering phones. We found somewhere else to eat that was open. Disappointing communication.
Le Magnifique,3.0,3,4,4,3,"We were in town visiting on holiday and booked this place because it was under the ‚Äúcasual‚Äù dining with only ¬£¬£ money signs but when we got there they were acting like it was a black tie affair. To spend ¬£20 on 5 cheese sticks is absurd. My husband & I split a main course because the prices were surprisingly expensive. Was also disappointed with the portions compared to the high cost.

The worst part was we had the chicken & mushroom dish and the sauce as well as the chicken arrived COLD. The fact that it was served in a skillet yet arrived under temperature was concerning. The flavor was good but for the cost, we should not have had cold food.
I would not recommend this place when there are SO SO many other options‚Ä¶be prepared for pretentious servers as well as an expensive bill."
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,"A delightful experience! Warm, friendly, cozy! Our last dinner in Paris so we ate at 7pm‚Ä¶early for Paris! They were understanding and certainly eager to please! Charming!"
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Great atmosphere, food, music and service. I will be back!"

We got the scallops and tuna and were not disappointed."
Le Magnifique,2.0,2,3,2,2,"Not a family place for dinner.  More of an adult clubby kind of place.  Food was good, but waitstaff is not as attentive as you might expect for a higher end dining menu."
Le Magnifique,4.0,4,4,5,4,"The food is really good, but I don‚Äôt recommend it for tourist. It‚Äôs more like for locals."
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Myself and my boyfriend had booked this for our first night in Paris and I could not fault the place, we truly had the most amazing experience here. The service was brilliant, all staff were extremely friendly and made us feel welcome. They even went the extra mile by getting some pain killers for me when I was having bad stomach cramps! The food was unreal and reasonably priced for the overall experience and location is right next to the Arc De Triomphe! Would recommend this place to anyone visiting Paris for a date night or a special meal with friends."
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,2,5,5,"The staff was outstanding, they have menu in English and the staff spoke English as well. The ambience was really good, great music playing on the background. The food was okay, they have a drinks menu but no sweet wines."

Just go and see for yourself. You won‚Äôt be disappointed."
Le Magnifique,1.0,1,3,1,2,Booked this restaurant as an anniversary meal for me and my partner. It is freezing in Paris so we are all wrapped up in winter scarf and hats etc. we walked in and we were immediately judged by the way we were dressed and were told by the man who greeted us ‚ÄòI have made it clear in the description it is smart casual but you can come in now just know for next time‚Äô. We felt very uncomfortable because of this and we felt as though it could have been dealt with better as this was said in front of other guests Can‚Äôt comment on the food or value as we didn‚Äôt stay for it.
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,4,5,5,"My boyfriend and I absolutely loved our evening. Beautiful, romantic restaurant with great food and wonderful music. Would definitely come back!"
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,"It was simply magic. Something happened between the amazing food, drinks, and the people (both staff and other visitors), that made our time at Le Magnifique incredibly unique.

The mood and the music was tremendous, we felt like we were being hosted by friends and family, and everything we tried was spectacular.

Can‚Äôt wait to return!"
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,4,"It was a little loud upstairs , but it was worth it. Food was amazing."
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,"A very warning and welcoming atmosphere with very well trained staff
A very polite girl ready to explain everything
The music really sounds of annold French restaurant of Paris
The food exquisite
We had filet de boeuf avec pommes frites !!!!
We had also the saint Jaques coquilles avec puree truffee not to be missed
We went three consequent evenings and we didn‚Äôt regret it
Its worth it
Bravo
We ll be back again"
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,The food was magnificent! The service was great and we enjoyed the music. A fantastic romantic dinner.
Le Magnifique,4.0,4,5,4,3,"The restaurant, food and staff were of a very high quality.  I made friends with the waitress and bartender quite easily. However I noticed when ever they stopped to engage, the owner/mgr/proprieter sent them away to do something else that seemed trivial, more or less it seemed to stop them talking with me..  But overall it was good."
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,"This is a great restaurant, the music, the decoration, the food, the wine‚Ä¶ everything .
We are from the the US, it‚Äôs a business dinner we thought we want to find a quiet place to meet, then this restaurant pops up!
Highly recommend."
Le Magnifique,3.0,3,4,1,2,Arrogant owner that ruined what should have been an excellent evening. If you don‚Äôt like the English or ‚Äúforeigners‚Äù as you referred to us then don‚Äôt take our bookings.
Le Magnifique,4.0,4,4,5,5,"Nice place, nice ambiance. to make it even better maybe slightly brighter (or not quite so dim) and music slightly quieter - just a little. Food and service were great"
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Had a lovely time and everyone was so helpful.
Loved our quaint little table for two upstairs."
Le Magnifique,3.0,3,3,4,3,Did not fully meet my expectations. Quality of food was good but relatively simple. Wine was very good.
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,"It was a great dining experience, the atmosphere was that of a private bar/dining experience. The staff were lovely and attentive to your every need. The portion sizes were huge so great value for money.

I would recommend anyone to go here as it in a true gem in Paris !"
Le Magnifique,3.0,3,4,2,1,Table was too small for 4 people and I‚Äôm not sure they even acknowledged we had a reservation
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Le d√Æner √©tait super !
L‚Äôambiance est chaleureuse et l‚Äô√©quipe au petit soin.
Petit coup de c≈ìur pour les fameuses coquillettes √† la truffe !
Les cocktails sont tr√®s bons √©galement, je recommande √† 100% !"
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,An absolute gem in Paris. The food was incredible and the ambiance was perfection. Scallops with truffle mashed potatoes were a delight‚Ä¶ and the setting in a corner on the velvet couch with the beautifully lit bar made the entire experience so special.
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I was very impressed the ambience of the restaurant after researching the menu online as I pressumed it would be more lively. It was very warm, calm and elegant. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. Service was excellent."
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,Service and food were great!
Le Magnifique,1.0,1,1,1,1,"We requested seating outside and after being seated, no one came out to give us water or take drink orders or anything. We waited for at least 20 minutes for someone to come out to wait on us, then we finally got up and left and went elsewhere. We had made reservations and someone had seated us so they knew we were there for dinner. Terrible service!!!!"
Le Magnifique,4.0,4,4,4,5,A little expensive but good Food and good menu. I had the Tuna Steak and mashed potatoes and it was good. The service was ok. The drinks are a little expensive. Would go again
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,Dinner with my dad it was nice

Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,The service was excellent and attentive.  Food superb.  Felt authentic.
Le Magnifique,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great little spot with no fuss high quality food. Even though it‚Äôs summer we choose to east inside and were not disappointed - loved the ambience of the place with its low lighting/high end bar and comfortable seats. Food wise the Goats cheese spring rolls with honey were delicious and main course steak was a well selected cut, superbly cooked. Cheese plate could have been better but by then I was full. Would recommend."
Le Magnifique,2.0,2,2,2,3,"Seemed like an ‚Äúoff‚Äù night for the restaurant.  It was a fine experience, that said I don‚Äôt think I would seek it out again."
Le Magnifique,4.0,4,4,3,5,Good food and atmosphere. Service could have been better but was usual Paris service.
Le Magnifique,3.0,3,2,4,3,"Ok food, but expensive for what it is. The restaurant itself is nothing special. I would not recommend it to a friend."

Restaurant Bachaumont,5.0,5,5,5,5,Absolutely fantastic food and experience. Great waiter.
Shirvan,5.0,5,3,5,5,"The experience overall was great, despite the incident about booking fee and timings. On website of OpenTable it was written my booking starts from 19:00, but in reality the restaurant opens at 20:00, the price of festive season menu  wasn‚Äôt mentioned on website either, which is not really convenient, because you book the place with certain expectations.
Food isn‚Äôt the best. 
Service was amazing, the manager at the door, she was amazing, very approachable and sweet, she honestly made my night, I wouldn‚Äôt stay of it wouldn‚Äôt be for her, she honestly deserve the raise,  the rest of team was also very attentive, energetic and fun, that‚Äôs kind of vibe you want to have for NY Eve celebration."

Shirvan,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Very bad attitude from staff, we booked and the refused to seated us."
Terminus Nord,5.0,5,5,5,5,Beautiful setting and ambience. The food was excellent and felt like fine dining. As with all French dining there is not a lot of room but that did not spoil our experience
Terminus Nord,1.0,1,1,4,4,The place was lovely until 2am when my son woke up with a very bad intoxication. Something in the food was bad
Terminus Nord,3.0,3,3,4,4,une bonne brasserie  cuisine traditionnelle classique de bonne qualit√©  et service attentif
Terminus Nord,4.0,4,5,4,4,Great place if you are catching the Eurostar.  Traditional French cuisine. Great seafood selection
Terminus Nord,5.0,5,4,5,5,F√ºr uns die Brasserie in Paris. Wir lassen das Terminus Nord Ôøºniemals aus und es ist entweder unser erstes oder letztes Essen in Paris. Ôøºüëçüòä
Terminus Nord,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Professional staff and amazing food, would definitely recommend eating here"
Terminus Nord,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Couldn‚Äôt find my booking, sat down after 6 minutes. Nobody came to serve. Asked several waiters - all were busy. Left."
Terminus Nord,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Waiter was amazing, service was good and didn‚Äôt feel rushed as we had a leisurely three course lunch. Food was amazing, the french onion soup and profiteroles were the highlight"
Terminus Nord,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Fantastic restaurant. Outstanding food, service. Highly recommended."
Terminus Nord,4.0,4,5,4,4,Great place to stop on the way home to UK via the train. The restaurant offers great brasserie classics in a smart setting. Good service.
Terminus Nord,2.0,2,2,3,2,"Sehr laut, Steak hatte falsche Garstufe, lediglich der Service war akzeptabel...werde das Restaurant nicht mehr besuchen"
Terminus Nord,3.0,3,3,3,4,Meh.  Very limited options for vegetarians/ pescetarians. I think there are better options in the neighborhood.
Terminus Nord,5.0,5,5,5,5,The food was wonderful.
Terminus Nord,5.0,5,5,4,5,"We were arriving on the Eurostar quite late, so prebooked Terminus Nord as it was right beneath our hotel and had the Parisian style we wanted to start our trip off with.
Despite a queue of people waiting, we were seated quickly (as we had a reservation) and the menu options suited all of our different tastebuds. The steak tartare was divine! My mother-in-law had a delicious tuna dish and my husband loved the veal. We also could not help but be tempted by the desserts. The profiteroles were delicious, as was the cr√®me br√ªl√©e. I had a colonel to end with (sorbet with vodka poured over it)!
There was a QR code so you could easily pay at the table, or the staff (who were friendly and spoke English) could bring you the bill and you could pay normally.
We thoroughly enjoyed our first meal in Paris and will definitely head back there."
Terminus Nord,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great atmosphere, food , and service.  A must venue on your trip to Paris."
Terminus Nord,5.0,5,5,5,5,I love this brasserie and no trip to Paris would be complete without a visit. Fantastic traditional French food served by career waiters who really know their stuff in beautiful art deco surroundings. What is not to like?
Terminus Nord,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Absolutely incredible! The whole experience blew us away, it felt like stepping back in time to the 1940‚Äôs. Initially booked as a pre- departure lunch to kill some time before catching the Eurostar, we didn‚Äôt have any expectations so we were pleasantly surprised at finding such a wonderful experience. The menu- exceptional. The children ate crab, mussels and prawns whilst I went for the Strasbourg Sauerkraut. My husband went for the fish and chips ( eye roll). Absolutely delicious, beautifully presented and filling. The staff were plentiful and well rehearsed at providing service on par with The Ritz. They clearly take great pride in their vocation and execute it well. The decor was beautiful, plenty of light and space. There were many patrons and walk ins but it never felt crowded. Not to be missed. I truly look forward to returning."
Terminus Nord,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Cena de A√±o Nuevo, men√∫ fijo , calidad aceptable de los alimentos, servicio atento ."
Terminus Nord,5.0,5,5,5,5,Great food and convenient location. You cannot come to Paris and not stop at this iconic restaurant. Their desserts are incredible and great wine selection.
Terminus Nord,2.0,2,4,1,3,The waiter was pretty intense and very rude to us when we didn‚Äôt want to order three courses. If that‚Äôs a requirement it should be told when booking.
Terminus Nord,4.0,4,5,5,5,The asparagus and Parmesan risotto was AMAZING. The staff the was friendly and attentive. We appreciated the service and food overall. It was a nice way to begin to our Paris adventure.
Terminus Nord,4.0,4,5,5,5,"No se si es un problema del restaurante o de OpenTable, pero la reserva no aparec√≠a en el libro de reservas, es cierto que el restaurante solucion√≥ inmediatamente!"
Terminus Nord,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We were very pleasantly surprised by this restaurant, given its proximity to the train station. Our assumption had been that it was too ‚Äúobvious‚Äù to be of such quality.

We were dining with our (adult) son, who unfortunately had a migraine attack just as we arrived. He had to leave, so my wife and I simply had a half bottle of very excellent wine and two appetizers, which were delicious. We took our son‚Äôs dinner (roasted chicken with mushrooms) home for him to eat there and he dubbed it ‚Äúwonderful.‚Äú

What most impressed us was the flexibility of the service. Our waiter was extremely accommodating. Most impressively, he wanted to be sure that we did not have too long of a distance to take our son‚Äôs dinner home (we were staying just one block away), as he did not want it to be ‚Äústale‚Äú by the time we got it to him.

We will definitely return and, hopefully, enjoy a ‚Äúcomplete‚Äú meal next time."
Terminus Nord,5.0,5,5,5,5,Absolutely loved everything about our visit. Food and service was outstanding!
Terminus Nord,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Perfect for lunch before getting on the Eurostar.  There are cheaper restaurants nearby but this one provides good food, delivered swiftly and excellent service.  The prawn and avocado starter was fresh and light and the Irish steak cooked ‚Äòsaignant‚Äô absolutely lovely.  That coupled with a couple of glasses of Bordeaux and you are guaranteed a snoozy ride home to London.  Will definitely be our lunch stop on the way home in future.  Location couldn‚Äôt be more convenient."
Terminus Nord,4.0,4,4,4,4,Very courteous staff and a very convenient location for travelling.

Terminus Nord,3.0,3,3,4,3,"Bon moment entre copains, mais 50 euros par personne c‚Äôest quand m√™me tr√®s cher pour un repas sans vin ..."
Terminus Nord,3.0,3,3,5,4,We loved every minute of the meal although we suffered some side effects later (oysters and potentially the steak tartar). The choice is wide and the seafood on the next table gargantuan.
Terminus Nord,5.0,5,4,5,4,Lovely staff. Good food.
Terminus Nord,2.0,2,4,2,5,Average food. Below-average service. They tried passing kidneys as liver before admitting they ran out
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great food, great service, great value. Will definitely visit again when next in Paris!!"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Group of 6 diners staying in Paris for the rugby world cup had a really good meal seated on the round table.
Excellent food menu with unusual options very well presented. High quality.
Drinks menu held a wide wine offer. Also, unlike some restaurants, some non alcoholic beer/lager was available which was much appreciated.
Service was discrete but attentive.

High quality dining at medium to high budget.

Well done...5 stars from the group."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,2.0,2,3,1,3,"The service was the worst I‚Äôve encountered anywhere. Waiter never checked on us, water ran out and we had to repeatedly ask for more, condiments were brought 10 min after food. One meal out of the six came 20 min after the rest and no apology was offered. Waiter reprimanded me over not cutting the appetizer with the right knife - which he hadn‚Äôt yet brought, and scolded my 12 year old son of playing with the butter knife. Worst meal in Paris. The waiter did the whole ‚Äúand this new iPad is going to ask you if you‚Äôd like to tip.‚Äù Um, seriously? First, service fee is included in France, but despite this, we tipped extra anywhere the service was good. This guy should‚Äôve comped my husbands meal for coming after the rest of ours. Worst service we experienced. Scottish eggs were good and the fish and chips were tasty. Other than that, the meal was just ok. You can find far better in Paris."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,We celebrated our wedding day here! Excellent food and service. The GM was willing to leave the restaurant open for our party to celebrate the great day! We plan on coming back again! Thank you so much for everything!
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,5,3,4,The food was fantastic had the pea and mint salad and it was amazing!  Shepherds pie and fish and chips were fantastic.  Waiter is as just okay and not very welcoming
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,1.0,1,1,2,4,"We ordered three steaks. All of them were ordered medium rare and they came out medium well. The location is beautiful, but the restaurant is very mediocre."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,4,4,We ordered the fish and chips as an appetizer.it was outstanding! The beef Wellington was tasty and the shepherds pie was wonderful. Star dish was the fish and chips!
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Beautiful atmosphere, excellent wine selection, impressive signature cocktails, best British food I have ever had and personal attention from the owner and his team making the entire experience off the charts."

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,Our server Michael was attentive. Very funny and totally made our night exceptional. We were a little early for our seating and he right away brought us drinks while we waited outside. I cannot recommend this place enough. It was beautiful inside but not at all stuffy.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excelente servicio; el mejor filete. Lo recomiendo mucho
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"¬° Excelente ! Teppan Grill , es casi id√©ntico a Touzan , el Restoran de men√∫ kaiseki y sushi en HYATT de Kyoto , la decoraci√≥n es casi igualita , incluso el jard√≠n trasero de Teppan Grill es muy parecido al HYATT en Kyoto.
Teppan , cuando estaba en primer piso antes Nikko y hoy HYATT que mudo de lugar , siempre ha sido excelente , la calidad de su comida , los vinos , la gran variedad de Sake , su men√∫ m√°s internacional y no tan japon√©s , tambi√©n para algunas personas lo hace atrayente , a√∫n as√≠ sigue respetando el men√∫ teppan yaki , la calidad de sus Nigiris y sashimis.
Sus privados son perfectos y el privado 1 , el mejor Salon privado de toda la CDMX. Se los recomiendo. Cuando vayan pidan que les cocine Alberto. No se van arrepentir. Es el mejor."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,We were visiting Paris from US and chose here for our NYE dinner.  Service was impeccable.  Food was amazing.  It was a perfect intimate setting to bring in the New Year.  Definitely recommend to any looking for a local restaurant in Paris that will not disappoint.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,4,5,4,NYE with family. It is a special place.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,2.0,2,1,3,2,"Felt very rushed. Manager taking plates and drink glasses before we were even finished. Food was not good.
Holiday roast was very dry. Could tell it had been sitting around all day. Would not go back.
Waitress was very pleasant."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,1.0,1,2,1,3,Advertised 55‚Ç¨ per person but once you were there they charged 75‚Ç¨ per person. The food was mediocre. The service was beyond awful. Do not recommend
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,5,5,5,Not Sunday roast on Sunday
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent food and service, we sat in a quiet corner at the bar. Good evening."

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I chose this for reviews, menu, and ability to walk from hotel. The staff was outstanding‚Äîwelcoming and understanding that we normally eat earlier than folks in Paris. They welcomed us, and we enjoyed drinks until restaurant opened. 
Excellent food, customer service fantastic"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,I went in all by myself as a shy American but they made my night. Thank you so much üòä

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,4,4,"Had the beef wellington and the shepperd's pie, both were excellent."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"My wife and I had a wonderful experience.  The owner, Oliver, and staff made us feel right at home.  The food was simple, authentic British fare. I enjoyed the Shepard‚Äôs Pie, and my wife had the Beef Wellington.  We finished with sticky toffee pudding, YUM!  Before we knew it, two and a half hours had passed by.  I strongly recommend this fine establishment for anyone looking for no nonsense hearty delicious food in the heart of a city renowned for faux cuisine.  Ok, there are some great restaurants in Paris, but they are not easy to find if you are a tourist, not a fluent French speaker, and don‚Äôt feel like taking out a second mortgage for a table at a Michelin star restaurant."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,Amazing food! Great owner and staff
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,5,5,Subdued but still special New Year‚Äôs Dinner. The food was tasty and the drinks were made to perfection.

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,4,4,5,"Cosy and surprinsingly quiet brasserie. Original food, with quality products. Service was discreet, yet effective. 
I had a nice time and will gladly Come back."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,3,5,5,"We went there for a brunch. 
It's a lovely, warm place with very professional and friendly staff. 
However, the price/quality ratio is quite high. I would say it is nice but a little bit deceiving, as quite expensive for the food. 
Still we need to go back and try other dining plates and different foods."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Simply the best fish and chips in Paris .. and endive salad with stilton and walnuts to start was perfect. 
Love l'Entente!"

We found the non-alcoholic drinks a little bit overpriced.
That was our only concern.
Thank you for your warm welcome,

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,3,4,5,When we arrived there was two couples. We had champagne and our starters. The starters were nice. The mains were really bad we had the fillet steak which appeared to be almost like a sirloin steak really fatty. The beef wellington was cold the mash potatoes to go with were also cold. Considering we had to wait some time for the mains we chose not to send them back. The waiter was really nice he was under pressure because the restaurant was understaffed. We waited nearly 30 minutes for our dinner plates to be removed from our table for them to be removed by our request. Considering we were one of the first to arrive and to watch others getting served before us was kind of a thought that we were forgotten about. The dessert were average in there presentation and taste. Price ‚Ç¨190.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,3,3,4,"We came here for Valentine‚Äôs Day and it was somewhat disappointing. Our server was very sweet and helpful but you could tell he was very busy due to being understaffed so things took forever to come out. It took 10 minutes for us to be given menus, another 15 for our order to be taken, and so on. The food was alright but nothing special. We ended up being seated next to a lovely couple that we talked to for awhile but overall we spent 2 hours in the restaurant and only ate for probably about 30 minutes."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I love this place, unique in Paris. Nice people and excellent service, beautiful design, great english spirit, excellent food.  Unfortunately, too expensive to go as often as I would like !"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,We have been to the restaurant for brunch before but this was the first time for lunch. Our meals were great and the service was top!
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,2.0,2,2,2,2,"Cuisine peu inventive mais correctement  ex√©cut√©e (sans plus)

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I love the relaxed feel of this place ‚Äì like a comfortable dining room in a friends home. I definitely would return to try more dishes. The New Year‚Äôs menu was excellent and my evening was beyond my expectations. The host and servers were amazing and made us feel welcomed. It felt like a New Year‚Äôs Eve with family. Service was well-timed and friendly, wines were affordable."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,4,"We dined on New Year's, so there was a Prix Fixe Menu. I booked the reservation and received a prompt call explaining we'd need to select from three (meat, vegetarian or fish) and pay in advance. We did so, selecting the meat option, which included an artichoke soup, duck confit terrine, beef wellington and a chocolate cake. The soup and beef wellington were really outstanding."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"This was the second time we had eaten here in the last month. It was so good the first time that we came back with some other friends; and it was just as excellent this time. Excellent service, delicious food and a selection of wines that made choosing very hard. We especially appreciated the suggestions for digestifs to accompany the desserts. We‚Äôll be back in 2020 that‚Äôs for sure."

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,4,3,"I had read about this English brasserie in a travel,guide and as it was very close to,our hotel at Paris Opera we decided to go there for dinner on Sunday evening. Nice interior but lacking in atmosphere and the music was both too loud and not particularly pleasant to listen to while dining. But the service, menu and the food made up for this, I had the scotch quail eggs with picalilly for starters and the beef Wellington for mains, both excellent, and large servings so no room for dessert!"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Delicious food, great wine, and a fantastic team working in a very nice space. I‚Äôm a repeat customer and love eating at this restaurant."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,A long time favourite in Paris. Their week-end brunch is the best!
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,5,4,4,Food excellent. Good service.  Good ambiance. Only negative point: very expensive.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,We spent a lovely evening here. Delicious and original British classics and French brasserie fusion with very welcoming and friendly staff. One of the best meals I‚Äôve eaten this year and a very interesting wine list with some gems like the Chinon you don‚Äôt find elsewhere. Comfortable and calm environment where you can have a good conversation.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I had dinner with my wife and children. Excellent service and good food. Owner was kind enough to spend a few minutes with us, which added to the evening. I would highly recommend"

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,3,5,5,Want great comfort food in Paris? Go. Especially Sunday brunch.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We've been to the Boathouse and The Tavern on the Green in Central Park and this experience beats them both. Attentive service, without interfering, the best cocktails (the Bloody Mary is epic and barman very helpful and skilled). Great food sourced from top suppliers really shows through. Lovely ambience, just French and just British enough to completely back up its name. I cannot recommend this place highly enough, it really made the Sunday before our silver wedding anniversary. I have travelled a lot both with my family and for business and I would actively seek it out for both."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,A great atmosphere and high quality food! We had a very nice time and will definitely return.

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"For our son's birthday  (30 years), the dinner was wonderful. After a nice cocktail at the bar, we went for the dinner. Recommendations from the owner were excellent : ""Kidneys"" as an entree and ""Chicken & leek"" pie as main, and also an excellent wine from South of France, excellent English cheese and a surprise wine from the Gers in Digestive.
The English ambiance of the brasserie was exactly what we expected. Bravo."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I love this place; there's nothing I can find to critisize - the ambience is wonderful (calm but exciting, beautiful decor!), the food is great quality and delicious, and the service is amazing. I felt really taken care of. I'd also recommend the basil and cucumber martini.
I discovered that alongside lunch and dinner, they do a great brunch and cater for business meetings.
I'd give it 12/10 and will definitely be going back."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,5,4,Very friendly and responsive staff. Very good food.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Follow an interview by the English/French magazine ¬´¬†vocable¬†¬ªconducted by Shelly, the restaurant and the main course we were discribed properly.

Thanks again."

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"I was meeting a cousin who I hadn't seen for many years, and we spent time looking at family photos together.  The waiters didn't hurry us, and in spite of the fact that we were among the first to arrive at midday and the last to leave when the waiters were preparing the tables for the evening, we didn't feel harassed.  Everyone was polite and patient.  One suggestion: that you put the name of the nearest metro on your website."

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,3,3,2,"Nice place with a good crowd on this Friday lunchtime.
The main issue with l'Entente lies in the variety of dishes: a very short list without any renewal since it was opened.
Service is nice and friendly."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,D√©cor soign√© et cuisine excellente. Mention sp√©ciale pour le dessert. Je n‚Äôai jamais mang√© une cr√®me au citron aussi d√©licieuse.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Delicious food, very friendly bilingual staff, a little pricey. We will be back for tea and crumpets!"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,5,4,4,"The service was good in general, unfortunally the restaurant had an event at the Louis Vouiton Foundation so everybody at the restaurant was working on that and service maybe was a little bit slower than normal, but food was good, I would say that the only bad thing was that at the moment of pay the check they had problems with their terminal, so finally I had to pay in cash, fortunally I was preapred but my first intention was to pay by credit card. The place is nice, the environment warm and nice music. I definitely reccomend it"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We booked an oudoor table for 2 at 10:45 pm, but we could not arrive before close to 11:00 pm, shortly before the closure of service. We called to inform of our delay which did not seem to create any inconvenience to the staff. We greatly appreciated that.

Food was very good as well as wines and we were very well advised for both. We were even given the chance to taste free of charge a glass of a red wine that the waiter (sorry that I can't remember his name) believed we would like, which was the case.

Atmosphere was relaxed and friendly. Service was very efficient, smiling and with a clear customer care attitude, contrary to many ""franco-french"" restaurants.

A very, very good experience. L'Entente clearly deserves its referencing in ""Le Fooding"" where we found it"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excellent restaurant typiquement british.  Les plats sont un d√©lice !  Bravo pour la parenth√®se britannique au coeur de Paris !

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,3,3,5,"Well,
I made the joice based on review I read on the net and regret it based on:
-the fish and chips we both had ordered: good chips, bad fish ( lot of crust and very few fish!)
-the lady waitress was not that friendly
-no British beer"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,1.0,1,4,1,4,"They added 30% to our bill.  We asked about it and they had no explanation but wouldn‚Äôt deduct it from the bill.  It wasn‚Äôt tax, it wasn‚Äôt for service.  Just 30% added."

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Un chef cr√©atif, une cuisine divine, un lieu o√π l‚Äôon peut prendre le temps de d√©guster, discuter et un patron enthousiaste et passionn√©. En espeyque le Brexit ne compliquera les futurs approvisionnements en Stilton et autres d√©lices."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,4,4,Great place great food but a bit disappointed: not a single English beer
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Nice place, nice food, nice people. Only quantity was a bit poor comparing to the one I eat in London. Service was good but could be better, we had to ask for almost everything."

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,5,3,4,"Beautiful Brasserie with an English twist. Food was delicious and great value for money. The service was very nice, but almost two hours at lunch for entr√©es a main course and coffee was too long... Especially in a business neighborhood...

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,5,5,"Great food and  service. The only regret we had is that one should be able to drink a pint of stout with a pheasant pie. I am aware that you are not a pub, but the choice of beer is really poor."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Parfait!
Nous reviendrons pour le brunch du dimanche !

N'h√©sitez pas √† mettre √† la carte le B≈ìuf Wellington !"

Points d'am√©lioration : att√©nuer le bruit + proposer des vins natures."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,4,3,4,"I went for lunch with my husband for my birthday, on arrival the waitress was very pleasant, wished me a happy birthday too. Atmosphere and decor of the restaurant are really nice. We ordered a cocktail to start, but we're then told we couldn't have one because they had no bar man. Then we ordered food, I'm vegetarian and didn't fancy the one veggie main option so I had a starter with a side of triple cooked chips which looked amazing...but they never arrived so I just had a salad starter and felt a bit sorry for myself with no cocktail and no chips. We had dessert of sticky toffee pudding which was really very good and then just as we were paying the bill I was brought some more cake with a birthday candle and an apology for the mistake. All in all I would say if the restaurant is in top form it's a great place to eat, maybe I just had an unlucky day there."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,1.0,1,1,1,1,"We had to wait for more than an hour and a half to get our orders, the staff didn‚Äôt give us any explanations, even though we asked them to do so repeatedly. We thereby ended up quite frustrated when the food did come, which gave it a rather bitter taste..."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,Just a very nice place to eat - all good - as it should be . We will go back .

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We visited L'Entente for the very first time, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  The space was warm and welcoming, as was the staff.  Our food was delicious and prepared exactly as described.  We would not hesitate to recommend."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,3,4,"As an American going on 5-6 days in Paris, it was nice to get some ""real"" food after eating a lot of bread, sugar, and nutella at many authentic Parisian places. The medium steak was great."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,2.0,2,1,5,5,"We were there to celebrate New years eve and there was a  NYE menu. We really did not like that pre selected food, but the staff was amazing."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,I love L'Entente : always outstanding meals in a beautiful place.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,4,5,"My 17 yr old son and I ate at L'Entente on New Years Eve.  It was a prix fixe meal because of the occasion. Overall we had a wonderful experience.  The food was excellent and the pace of the meal was perfect.  The only slip up was that our waiter forgot the first course (Oysters) which we realized after we saw that the people next to us got served correctly.  The owner apologized and asked if we still wanted our Oysters after we had been served our soup.  Yes!  Our waiter also mumbled a lot and we had to ask him to speak up.  Regardless, I would return."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,Spent New Years - Service and attention was excellent on a busy night.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,4,3,Good food but night was very busy and started off quiet but got very load from a large table of visitors and hot. You can expect this on a busy night as does not detract from a wonderful restaurant. No hesitation in recommending
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,3,5,Very good food. Owner very pleasant and passionate about his food.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Beautiful restaurant, food was great and staff were very polite and helpful. Would definitely recommend the steak was cook beautifully and tasted great!"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,4,1,4,"The food was good but at 8.30 they ran out of the dish we wanted - in a menu with 5 main dishes, that seems a bit pushing it . The food itself was good, but our waiter was extremely arrogant . The interior is beautiful . But I wouldn't go back there."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"It was excellent ! Nice atmosphere and service, outstanding dishes !"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,4,4,Nice brunch with a british immersion : walnut salad with pear and stilton is delicious ! Good eggs benedict.

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,Un grand merci pour l‚Äôaccueil et le service adorable.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,5,3,4,"Excellent food, wines on offer should propose some a little cheaper (I can suggest one if you are interested, and can bring Oliver a bottle to try).
A detail, but a little annoying, which needs remedying‚Ä¶.twice the waiter brought us the dishes ordered by another table and vice versa..."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,Lovely spot for a bit of British food in Paris. We will be heading back in the near future
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,4,4,Good food and service.  Nice decor and comfortable for a group get together or couples.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Tr√®s bon diner, original (tartelette poireaux/haddock √† tomber, le shepherd's pie bon mais sans √™tre outsandind) tr√®s bon vin!!"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,4,4,Cosy atmosphere with a very good but friendly service. Good  & unsual food (good chicken pie is hard to find in Paris). We'll be back !

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,what a treat. wonderful experience. food and wine were terrific.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,2.0,2,1,1,4,"Despite being recommanded by the owner, the brunch is one of the worst experiences we‚Äôve ever had in a while. We‚Äôve been served cold and flavorless plates after an hour and half wait time. Very poor service and assistance. A family treat turned into a disaster."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Le cadre tr√®s british est particuli√®rement plaisant. Fish & Ships & Entrec√¥te vous donneront comme moi, l'envie d'y retourner.
Merci."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,5,3,4,"L'Entente is always a reliable quality the atmosphere and surroundings are great. The food is good and the smoked salmon the best ever  
The leather banquettes and quality cutlery add to the experience  The service is sometimes a little slow and erratic."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,3,2,2,"For english food  lovers, which I am, I would recommend the place. On the other hand, we were disapointed  not to have a better table as it was for my mother's birthday who is 80 and even though I made the reservation a while ago, it was impossible to get a round table. It was a bit noisy so dificult for her to get it all.  Also the service was ok, not super nice."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,3,3,3,"Great place to eat and hang out. Quiet location. Service was great. Real British food. However, I especially came as there was apple crumble on internet menu and when I asked for it, they explained it was an old menu that needs to be pulled down :-( VERY disappointed so didn't stay for dessert. But defo recommend if you're craving some good old British home comfort food."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,2.0,2,2,1,3,"Service tr√®s tr√®s lent, et sans courtoisie. Nous avons eu l'impression de d√©ranger toute la soir√©e.

Bouteilles de champagne servies chaudes parce qu'il ''n'y en avait plus au froid''."

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Well done l‚Äòentente AMAZING food brilliant service and very special interior and ambiance.
The coffe is seriously one of the best I‚Äôve ever had and the salmon is as well a great gift on the tongue too. The Sunday brunch Menue is just exemplary to want to hang and eat for hours as well with family and friends. So this place should not be missed out once dining in Paris! BRAVO way to go"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,5,5,4,"Une tr√®s agr√©able soir√©e dans une ambiance cosy. La nourriture est d√©licieuse, le double baked chocolate cake sublime. Belle carte des vins. Patron et serveurs attentionn√©s."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,4,5,5,Excellentissimo but too expensive which is regretable for such a pleasant place
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Excellent setting, food, and wine selection.  Especially enjoyed the cheeses and the specialty British items."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,5,4,4,"Nous avons diner √† 4 dans ce restaurant pour mon anniversaire. Le service √©tait agr√©able, les produits sont frais et c'√©tait tr√®s tr√®s tr√®√®√®√®s bon ! Je recommande ce restaurant pour tout occasion et j'y retournerai avec plaisir !"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,3,5,Tr√®s bon restaurant. La nourriture est tr√®s qualitative. Le patron sympa et bienveillant. Toutefois on peut noter un manque d'exp√©rience de la part de certains serveurs.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,5,1,5,"Ce fut un grand plaisir de venir manger anglais. Les plats √©taient magnifique et succulent. La seule ombre au tableau fut un des serveur (celui qui parle le mieux fran√ßais) qui √©tait horriblement d√©sagr√©able par son attitude exasp√©r√©e et soul√© d'√™tre pr√©sent. J'ai d√©couvert pour la premi√®re fois, une personne ""rouler des yeux"" apr√®s quelques questions. En dehors de √ßa, le cadre est magnifique, le patron super souriant et accueillant.
La nourriture est vraiment bonne. On regrettera le prix un ""poil"" excessif."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,4,3,3,"last night in Paris; very hot day; no air conditioning...amateur service; it's nice that the staff is british & tries to speak French but not the best understanding...fridge was broken so instead of telling us, we waited forever for the white wine, still not cold enough after being rushed on ice.  food was rushed to the table, no downtime in between courses...not our style of enjoying food in a restaurant
too bad as the food was very good!
had terrine & sausages, both excellent"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,3,5,"Food was great, the Shepherds pie is fantastic. Service has lots of room for improvement, but was satisfactory overall."

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,Excelente servicio! Volver√≠a sin dudarlo!
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,2.0,2,2,1,4,"A very disappointing evening for a Franco-British family get-together : It was imposible to change the reservation on Open Table to add a cover so when we arrived we were given the worst - and hottest - table in the restaurant because it was supposedly full ...  it  was however half empty and the maitre d'hotel kindly moved us to another.   The service was friendly but very amateurish.  The food was very disappointing  (especially the hake which was charred underneath).   Taking all this into account, we considered that the bill was far too high and we will definitely not recommend this restaurant."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The food was excellent british cuisine and the staff as well, all bi-lingual. Service was friendly and responsive. If you miss spending time in London and a proper English breakfast, go here, you won't be dissappointed!"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,4,4,4,"Went there for the Saturday brunch. The full Entente was excellent. Great atmosphere inside. Very attentive and friendly service. 
I will surely come back."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Un restaurant parfait!. Et je p√®se mes mots!
D'autant que c'est os√© d'ouvrir une brasserie britannique en plein Paris! 
Une d√©coration chic, douce et paisible √† la foi;  un patron professionnel, acceuillant et passionn√©; une √©quipe chaleureuse et sympathique et surtout une cuisine remarquable avec des produits de grande qualit√© et d'une grande fra√Æcheur. Les go√ªts sont justes et les assaisonnements subtils. 
Je n'ai qu'une envie: y retourner. 
NB: j'y suis all√©e le lendemain de l'attentat au couteau de la rue Monsigny qui a eu lieu devant le restaurant.  Mention sp√©ciale √† l'√©quipe pour avoir ouvert et qui plus est, nous avoir remerci√© de ne notre pr√©sence."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,What a perfect welcome on our first night in Paris!  From the warm inviting atmosphere to the amazing and delish food!  One of the best values in the area!  The owner was courteous and took the time to say hello and good bye to every patron!  Great bar atmosphere as well!  We highly recommend you stop in and try it!!
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Oliver and his team looked after us brilliantly.  The Shepherds pie, and thrice cooked chips with homemade ketchup was delicious.  As was the Treacle tart.
Highly recommended.  Look forward  to a return visit!!"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch here
English classics delicately done"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,2.0,2,3,1,2,Slowest restaurant ever. Very very average
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great food with a British twist. Open all day, every day."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,Top comme a l‚Äôouverture !! Continuez et bravo pour le service et l‚Äôaccueil aussi important que la cuisine !!
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Nous sommes un couple anglais qui avait lu un article √©logieux dans le journal The Daily Telegraph. Le brunch √† l'anglaise - ≈ìufs au plat, bacon, saucisse, tomates, champignons (absence totale de ""hash brown"" de scuire de bois ! - √©tait un r√©gal de qualit√© et de saveur, et fort pr√©f√©rable au brunch fran√ßais qui est trop sucr√© pour nous. La sauce brune est fait maison. La serveuse australienne √©tait attentionn√©e et chaleureuse, le patron inlassablement omnipr√©sent. Il saluait, expliquait, faisait la bise aux habitu√©s, notait les commandes, servait les plats ‚Ä¶ Merci et bonne continuation de la part de Paul et Lynne Bradshaw"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,3,5,4,"A very friendly welcome and attention from the staff. The high table seating is not the most comfortable. 
The food is good without being excellent. For instance, the steak was rather tough, although the flavour was excellent.
All in all though, I don't regret going there."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,4,4,4,"This new spot is a neighborhood gem, done right.  The owner trained in the US, the food is excellent, and the staff is attentive"

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Very tasty, fresh, high quality food. Ambiance is very friendly. Staff is attentive and nice. Restaurant looks very nice. And great shepherd's."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We were in Paris for a week from Canada, to celebrate my husband and daughters birthdays. We were also joined with other family members from the UK. 

When last in Paris 15 or 20 years ago it seemed like every little restaurant,  brassiere or patisserie we went to had excellent food. This time was so different - the only place that was vaguely good was the local patisserie around the corner from our hotel. It seems many of the restaurants in Paris are now parts of big chains and the quality of the food has sadly declined. We had not had one really good meal our whole time and were feeling quite disappointed as we had so been looking forward to great food - especially the night of our birthday celebration.

Then on our last night in town we went to L'Entente. Being mostly Brits, we weren't sure this was the place to go in Paris but were we ever glad we did! This place is spectacular. It's only been open 4 months and 8 days - as told to us by the delightful owner Oliver, but it is already a gem of a place to go. It's beautifully appointed, staff is exemplary but the best part is the food. Everyone's meals were outstanding - from starter to dessert. 

I wish I had taken better pictures - the place is much prettier than my pictures show. Also should have taken pictures of the food - especially before half eaten - but oh that gingerbread and caramel sauce was soooo good! 

A big thank you to L'Entente for a fabulous last meal in Paris!"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,Fantastic delicious food in a very chic environment. Courteous and attentive staff and lovely ambience. Highly recommended! The shepherd‚Äôs pie was the best I‚Äôve ever had...
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great food, classic British fare but done extremely well, wonderful service and atmosphere, highly recommended"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,3,5,5,"Excellente nouvelle adresse un peu d√©cal√©e. M√©riterai quelques plats plus ""r√©gime""."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Enjoyed all aspects of this place. Service was excellent and it was a great break from traditional French food, especially for a vegetarian!"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Being English, living in Paris, we thought it would be fun to get together with other British friends and have brunch here. It was highlighted in a number of British newspapers as very authentic English cuisine, so we decided to give it try. We were definitely not disappointed, it was excellent. Oliver, the owner, welcomed us and is genuinely enthusiastic about making this work. 

If you are looking for some tradional English Fare in Paris, then this is definitely a place to go."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,3,4,Un peu cher mais tr√®s bonne qualit√©. Service un peu sec de la serveuse mais tr√®s bien rattrap√© par le responsable du restaurant.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,5,4,Tr√®s bonne id√©e ce restaurant anglais avec des bons produits du terroir fran√ßais. √âquipe sympathique qui expliquent bien ce qui est dans l'assiette. Unique √† Paris. √Ä essayer.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Really great restaurant with a beautifully appointed interior. I loved the colour of the wood paneling and the lighting of the bar. Absolutely delicious British classics made with fresh French produce. The shepherd‚Äôs pie was terrific and, in my opinion, just as good as the one served at the Ivy. Oliver and his staff are fantastic. I will definitely be back!"

L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,5,1,4,Des plats excellents qui ont malheureusement √©taient ternis par un service long et peu efficace.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,My wife and I love it here. We recently celebrated our tenth wedding anniversary here. Food is always delicious and the service is top notch.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"This was my second time at L'Entente, and it didn't disappoint! Amazing quality ingredients, authentic British dishes and a lovely atmosphere. Would recommend for any occasion!"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,3,4,4,"Un menu d√©jeuner excessif pour le quartier et pour la qualit√© des mets.
C'est une cuisine quelconque qui manque de personnalit√©.
Le service est bon et lieu est tr√®s joliment d√©cor√© mais √ßa ne suit pas dans l'assiette."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,4,3,"As an expat in Paris, I loved the English food done with style!  The started of quail scotch eggs was delicious, and the staff were extremely friendly and attentive."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Excellente cuisine typiquement anglaise.
Mention sp√©ciale pour les desserts d√©licieux et l√©gers √† la fois.
Je reviendrai pour tester le brunch... s'il est encore propos√©."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,3,3,3,J'ai trouv√© l'endroit globalement agr√©able  seul b√©mol j'ai trouv√© les quantit√©s tr√®s petites surtotu pour le prix...21 euros les oeufs b√©n√©dictes vraiment petit et sans garniture ....
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,5,5,5,Tres belle adresse de qualit√© ! Id√©al pour un brunch √† l‚Äôanglaise √† deux ou en famille.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,4,3,3,"Un repas de bonne qualit√©, mais des prix parfaitement scandaleux.
Des plats on√©reux et sans accompagnements (payants car en suppl√©ment, et tr√®s chers pour de petites quantit√©s).
Nous ne reviendrons pas malgr√© la bonne saveur des produits."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Outstanding.

I ordered the same dish as last time, just to check the restaurant's consistency. Full marks there.  Not so consistent on the G&T, and it was served to me in a wine glass, so I'll take a few marks off there. 

The service was superb, and the owner and manager his typical congenial self.  He answered all our questions on the lovely d√©cor, the interesting artwork on the walls, the wine, their meat suppliers, and a whole lot of other things. They were terribly busy that evening, but he still took the time to have a friendly little chat. He should be giving masterclasses on customer relations.

Otherwise, may I suggest adding cheesy peas to the menu? If the French don't get the joke, we can always educate them, what?"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,5,5,3,Plats d√©licieux. Produits de qualit√©. Service aux petits soins. Bravo !
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,I intend to repeat the experience . Most pleasant evening. Quiet but not too much. The fish was perfectly cooked and the ginger loaf is a must-have
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,3,2,4,Le lieu est agr√©able et original. Le choix de plats est limit√©. Le choix des vins est encore plus limit√©. Le service est de bonne volont√© mais plut√¥t amateur.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Great staff,wine and truly delicious food."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,The staff are really lovely and it is always a pleasure to eat there. Went for brunch and the poached pear granola was excellent.
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,3,4,4,"Accueil un peu confus mais la sympathie des serveurs et le charme British du patron l‚Äôemportent.

Tr√®s bons cocktails offerts par la maison pour patienter."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Un bon endroit pour d√©guster des mets typiquement british, une d√©co jolie et un service impeccable."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,3.0,3,2,4,4,"La carte Brunch est trop restrictive et surtout beaucoup l'addition est beaucoup trop √©lev√©e malgr√© des produits de qualit√© et une √©quipe sympathique. Un bravo √©galement pour la bande son!
Pourquoi ne pas proposer une carte lunch m√™me le samedi midi.
Dommage"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Heston Blumenthal eat your heart out. Here's a restaurant doing the best of British cuisine, in Paris, run by an Englishman, using the best French produce. Delicious, honest-to-goodness food, in a relaxed but refined restaurant, well lit, well designed. The downstairs is clean. The d√©cor is pleasant and pleasing. The owner and manager is congenial and polite. They gin and tonic was among the better ones I have imbibed. What more could we ask for?"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Best British restaurant in town, food is more than great, the place is awesome, the staff super professional and friendly. Michelin star service in a brasserie!"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Un lieu si british mais tellement frenchy! Savoureux, chaleureux et cool! √Ä consommer sans mod√©ration !"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,3,4,3,"Soir√©e tr√®s agr√©able, restaurant calme et service tr√®s attentionn√©. Ambiance british sympathique et originale. Recommandation des viandes : rognons et perdrix.
Tables rondes tr√®s appr√©ciables"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"British food in the heart of Paris that's incredible. A hit from the moment I walked in. Great warm welcome, awesome wines to try, fantastic cooking. Seriously, as good as it gets in the Bourse area.

The steak frites was incredibles. Perfectly cooked on the first try and the fries, were so on point. Real triple cooked chips. Not easy to find in the land of FRENCH FRIES...I can't wait to return."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Quality food, good service, nice setting, kids friendly place and food."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"EXCELLENT and absolutely DELICIOUS! The food is so original and a real
conversation starter, the space has been beautifully designed and feels very special."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Wonderful meal in a relaxed setting. Owner came up to us and even talked us out of a selection because he thought we ordered too much. He was right.

Food was delicious and service was impeccable. My wife and I loved it! Scotch eggs were firm and still creamy in the center. Fish cakes were firm and Shepard‚Äôs pie was about what we expected...not spectacular, but still good.

We will return!"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Last minute reservations, as everything was pretty much booked for that evening, glad we were able to make it in! Everything was delish, freshly prepared, attention to detail, owner even made it a point to come greet us and check in, to make certain everything was up to par, and that it was!  TheIr four of us, we had  the Hake fish, the fish cakes, and I, the  ribeye all top notch!  And did I  mention fresh ! They even make their own ketchup! Good Job üëè 

Thanks again all away from Floridaü§ìüëç"
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"L‚ÄôEntente has amazing food. The quail is a greater starter, followed by roasted partridge. I have not tasted a better steak and kidney pie outside of London in a long time . As well as the food, the service was outstanding with the owner taking the time to talk a little about the history and background to the restaurant. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great food and atmosphere."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Took my wife here to celebrate her birthday, and the entire team were very welcoming and, even though we briefly mentioned when we first arrived that it was her birthday, they brought her dessert out with candles in. A very nice touch. Excellent atmosphere!! Thanks for a lovely evening."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,We had an early lunch and the food and service were impeccable. The restaurant has been exquisitely designed and is fresh and comfortable. The staff were very friendly and I will definitely come back here again and recommend it to all my Parisian friends who are open-minded enough to sample fine British food!
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,4.0,4,4,5,4,"Excellent service, top quality products, good wine menu. The place is very comfortable, time flew ! We had a great time."
L'Entente - Le British Brasserie,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Four of us  had a memorable lunch at L'Entente Le British Brasserie on Thursday.  The proprietor gave us a warm welcome and was friendly and attentive without being in our faces.  Food was  delicious and the service was great.  We loved the blue decor, the leather banquette, the lovingly restored mural and the overall ambience.  Everything, even the acoustics, are just right.

We are recommending L'Entente to all friends and family."
Bolo Bolo,5.0,5,5,5,5,Everything was so good! We especially enjoyed the milk tea and the chow fun noodles. Very friendly place as well:)
Bolo Bolo,5.0,5,5,5,5,"This is comfort food at its best. The Beef Chow Fun was delicious, and don‚Äôt miss the milk tea! Service is super friendly and fast. I can‚Äôt wait to go back !"
Bolo Bolo,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Great food. Service is a little confused, but very pleasant. It‚Äôs hard to manage the tables bc they don‚Äôt have one main person to assist each table. Everyone does everything. The milk tea is heaven."
Bolo Bolo,4.0,4,5,4,4,"Yummy comfort food. The HK Fried rice was so tasty! Although my main dish (wide rice noodles and ‚Ä¶ 4 strips of beef) was kind of surprising. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was still delicious, even the beef‚Ä¶ however there were only a few strips of beef. It felt highly imbalanced. I would give them 5 stars if they had more beef on this dish since everything we had was delicious!"
Bolo Bolo,5.0,5,5,5,5,C‚Äô√©tait bien
Bolo Bolo,5.0,5,5,5,5,Best Asian! We like it and will back next time when we are in the town
Bolo Bolo,5.0,5,5,4,4,"En plus d‚Äôune belle d√©coration, d‚Äôune √©quipe bienveillante et le menu nous invitent √† pousser notre curiosit√©. Sans h√©sitation, nous reviendrons tester de nouveaux plats !"
Brasserie La Lorraine,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Bad quality & expensive place
Fish and chips was good"
Brasserie La Lorraine,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Service food and ambience all good. Menu gourmand was quite limited choice, but otherwise fine."
Brasserie La Lorraine,1.0,1,1,1,2,"Sorry to say that our experience was poor. Service was completely inattentive. Our server was disinterested and could not care less. Bread was dry, sitting out too long. Ordered ‚Äúmoules frites‚Äù. Both bowls of mussels came cold and dried out. Sent them back for fresh ones. Fries were cold on arrival. We sent  them back too. Mussels arrived but just mediocre at best. The ones on the bottom were dried out too. Bill came and they charged us extra for the fries, which come with the mussels. Server had to call the manager to correct the bill. Just not pleasant! Do not waste your precious time here to get a little traditional taste of France."
Brasserie La Lorraine,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excelentes mariscos, muy fresco y bien preparados."
Brasserie La Lorraine,4.0,4,4,4,3,"Amabilit√© de l'accueil table bien situ√© malheureusement enfants bruyants.

Brasserie La Lorraine,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Off the beaten path, this is nice, well established place with a great food, service and ambiance. Highly recommended."
Brasserie La Lorraine,5.0,5,5,5,5,Once again - amazing experience at the restaurant with my sister
Brasserie La Lorraine,2.0,2,4,1,5,The waiters were slow and un attentive. Gave us a short window of having our table before the next party arrived and then waited 30mins to take drink orders
Brasserie La Lorraine,3.0,3,4,2,3,"Overall good experience. Seemed like the staff were a bit overwhelmed at times. Service was slow and they didn't get a couple of our orders correct. Not a bad experience, just a bit of room to improve."
Brasserie La Lorraine,3.0,3,3,1,4,"Decent restaurant with good food. Service was very poor. Slow, inattentive and too busy talking with the other waitstaff."
Brasserie La Lorraine,5.0,5,4,5,4,"Un bon moment pass√© √† la Lorraine. Les plats sont des plats brasserie, sans fioriture inutile, les tables sont espac√©es et,  samedi dernier midi, le taux d'occupation √©tait √† peine de 50 %, ce qui est un bonheur pour les clients, car le service fut rapide, avec un personnel d√©tendu et attentif."
Brasserie La Lorraine,5.0,5,5,5,5,The food was excellent as well as the service. We enjoyed the sidewalk type restaurant with the open air ambiance
Brasserie La Lorraine,1.0,1,2,1,2,Our server ignored us and was arguing with his co-workers most of the time. The food was okay but not worth the price. I would not recommend this restaurant.
Brasserie La Lorraine,2.0,2,3,1,3,"I ordered salmon that was prepared well, but the service was the least attentive I have ever experienced. It took almost 15 minutes after sitting down just to get tap water, and I wasn‚Äôt given a plate to eat my appetizer. Additionally, I noticed the employees were actively arguing and making passive-aggressive comments and body language after receiving customer requests. I would expect much better from any restaurant."
Brasserie La Lorraine,5.0,5,5,5,5,"What a beautiful restaurant! The service was impeccable, the food was excellent and very good value for money. Would recommend it."
Brasserie La Lorraine,5.0,5,5,4,5,"Muy buena comida. Buen servicio y agradablemente decorado. Muy buena variedad de vinos. Ped√≠ el salm√≥n, un t√°rtara de dorado y un milfleur y todo excelente."
Brasserie La Lorraine,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Fantastic food and desserts are to die for. Never tried anything better than the millefeuille with roasted pistachios. If you like beautiful seafood and really great desserts, definitely try this place!

Ah, wine selection was also great!"
Brasserie La Lorraine,3.0,3,3,3,5,Birthday for my sister
Brasserie La Lorraine,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Muy buena comida, mariscos frescos y personal muy atento."
Brasserie La Lorraine,3.0,3,3,2,4,"Service was quite slow and at a few items were missed but otherwise staff were friendly. Felt a little bit like they were trying to get the bill up by giving us bottled still water when we asked for tap and for giving us 5 serves of chips for the table when we asked for 2 ? Food was ok, some dishes really nice and others quite underwhelming especially considering the price. Ok overall."
Brasserie La Lorraine,4.0,4,4,4,4,"El restaurante es t√≠pico franc√©s, la atenci√≥n es r√°pida, la comida creo que es est√°ndar y los precios son un poquito elevados"
Brasserie La Lorraine,5.0,5,5,5,5,Beautiful restaurant in beautiful Paris. Great food and ambiance.
Brasserie La Lorraine,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The service was friendly and professional, we were well attended to the entire evening.  Sitting out side I highly recommend."
Brasserie La Lorraine,2.0,2,2,3,2,"Nous voulions du homard comme inscrit sur la carte, il n'y en avait pas, les c√¥tes d'agneau pas non plus, des touristes √† la table voisine demandent un fisch and chips, pas non plus. Nous avons √©t√© assez d√©√ßu par la carte."
Brasserie La Lorraine,1.0,1,1,1,3,"Ran out of the common dish on the menu - Fish and Chips 
Party of 3 
First got our order  wrong salmon, beef fillet and linguine mussel pasta brought everything but the pasta .. brought veal Oder out . As for the dinner waited 30 min for the linguine not once did a server come to the table to make sure we were ok for anything . 
Salmon was undercooked 
Beef fillet was not cooked  to specifications asked for it medium and it was medium rare 
Linguine came extremely late"
Brasserie La Lorraine,3.0,3,4,4,4,"Food was good and nice Parisian brasserie decor. Unfortunately, we had a small brown mouse pay us a visit during our meal. Sniffing around the floor under tables close to us. Not really great.  From our waiter's reaction, i guess this happens regularly (maybe since the restaurent open to the outside for most of the day) . Nothing done other than kind of joke about it."
Brasserie La Lorraine,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Very professional stuff, breathable atmosphere, excellent food"
Brasserie La Lorraine,1.0,1,2,1,3,The food was uncooked and waiters were  blow cold. They added an extra drink to the receipt.
Brasserie La Lorraine,1.0,1,1,1,2,Super mal experiencia. No reconocen las reservaciones por open table porque no las pueden ver. El servicio p√©simo a se tardaron mas de 2 hrs en llevarnos el plato fuerte a tal grado que tuve que pedir la cuenta e irme frustrado. Solo dicen lo diento. Nunca regresar√≠a a este restaurante..
Brasserie La Lorraine,3.0,3,3,5,2,"We have been to this place based on recommendation. It was definitely a wonderful place at its heyday. It is dated a bit but clearly there are regulars. They struggled to find our reservation but still seated us. We ordered seafood and wine and service was good. But the crab in the seafood was inedible, no white crb meat in and strange smell. When complained they offre red is free desert which is good and decent. I would be just fine if it were our family restaurant at the corner of our street but it was our first holiday night in Paris and I would be happier with a better experience."
Brasserie La Lorraine,4.0,4,4,4,5,Trip to Paris
Brasserie La Lorraine,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Existen restaurantes con buen o mal servicio.  En este no dan servicio simplemente.  Estuvimos mas de 30¬¥ desde que llegamos, nos pasaron a nuestra mesa y nadie nos atendi√≥.  Decidimos irnos y tampoco les importo.  P√©simo, una lastima."
Brasserie La Lorraine,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Amazing food, excellent service"
Brasserie La Lorraine,4.0,4,4,5,5,"Nous avons beaucoup aim√© le cadre de cette brasserie. 
Service rapide, nourriture excellente.
Nous aurons plaisir √† revenir."
Brasserie La Lorraine,3.0,3,4,3,4,Hostess couldn‚Äôt find our reservation but seated us anyway since it was not busy. We had Champagne and lemonade for drinks and plat signature to share. My husband enjoyed his menu des 100 ans for $56.00. My Souffle grd marnier was just OK. We celebrated our 25 anniversary but nobody from the restaurant said anything.
Le Coq & Fils ‚Äì Chef Antoine Westermann (anciennement Le Coq Rico),2.0,2,3,1,3,"Restaurant states to notify them of food allergies prominently on their menu. I notified my server I have a dairy allergy and went over every item I order to make sure it cleared it. He confirmed everything I ordered was dairy free. For my final dish, dessert, I ordered a chocolate sorbet and lime sorbet. He brought me vanilla ice cream and chocolate ice cream. I took a bite of what I assumed was lime sorbet when I immediately realized it was vanilla ice cream. I immediately spit it out into my napkin and notified the server and manager/host. But to my chagrin, the level of professionalism of how it was handled by management was embarrassing for the establishment. You didn‚Äôt just mess up an order, you put someone‚Äôs life in jeopardy and acted if it could be fixed with serving a new dessert. Still in shock about the low level allergy hazard response. I ran to the bathroom trying to rinse it from my mouth. Your management handled that awfully. I give a little more credit to the server because he sought me out after I came out of the bathroom to send his apologies. We left without management acknowledging it. Just awful and unacceptable"
Le Coq & Fils ‚Äì Chef Antoine Westermann (anciennement Le Coq Rico),5.0,5,5,5,5,My sis & i had amazing delicious dinner last night at this wonderful restaurant! What a amazing start of the year we had! we never forget about the happy moment at this restaurant
Le Coq & Fils ‚Äì Chef Antoine Westermann (anciennement Le Coq Rico),1.0,1,1,1,1,"Very frustrating experience
Made a reservation, got the confirmation, made the journey to the restaurant and when got there I was told they did not have any table available
When i showed the reservation, they were clearly uncomfortable and blamed a potential problem in the reservation system (which is something that they should take care instead of telling the client that there is nothing they could do)"
Le Coq & Fils ‚Äì Chef Antoine Westermann (anciennement Le Coq Rico),5.0,5,5,5,5,Very friendly staff and accommodating. We were visiting from NY and so happy to have found this gem. Food was amazing. High recommended and will come back again when in Paris.
Le Coq & Fils ‚Äì Chef Antoine Westermann (anciennement Le Coq Rico),5.0,5,5,5,5,Fantastic food and service.   Very nice restaurant with great location.
Le Coq & Fils ‚Äì Chef Antoine Westermann (anciennement Le Coq Rico),4.0,4,5,5,4,"We dine here every time we are in Paris. We also enjoyed Le coq rico in NYC prior to closing. Of course the chicken is heavenly, with sides that accompany the meal that are also delicious. Highly recommended."
Le Coq & Fils ‚Äì Chef Antoine Westermann (anciennement Le Coq Rico),5.0,5,5,5,5,Such a unique concept. All things bird. The food was interesting and delicious. The service was very accommodating and pleasant.

Le Coq & Fils ‚Äì Chef Antoine Westermann (anciennement Le Coq Rico),5.0,5,5,5,5,Amazing food mmm try the chicken and the chocolate mousse is so good
Le Coq & Fils ‚Äì Chef Antoine Westermann (anciennement Le Coq Rico),5.0,5,5,5,5,Visiting Paris from Miami and this charming restaurant was recommended by our tour guide. Greeted by the charming owner who was an excellent host along with his staff. Delicious imaginative dishes. Bon apetit!
Le Coq & Fils ‚Äì Chef Antoine Westermann (anciennement Le Coq Rico),4.0,4,4,3,4,"Our sides came out incorrect, but I think there was a language barrier.  What we had was good."
Le Coq & Fils ‚Äì Chef Antoine Westermann (anciennement Le Coq Rico),5.0,5,5,5,4,Our favorite meal in Paris. It‚Äôs ‚Äújust‚Äù chicken but was excellent and our server made it all the better.
Exces,1.0,1,1,1,1,Je n‚Äôai pas pu tester le restaurant car ils ont d√©cid√© d‚Äôannuler toutes les r√©servations pour une privatisation mais ne nous ont pas tenu au courant. Nous sommes donc arriv√©es sur place pour nous faire dire de revenir un autre soir! Nous ne reviendrons pas.
Exces,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Excellent accueil, les vins √©taient tr√®s bon. 
Nous avons √©t√© super bien conseill√©s"
Exces,5.0,5,5,5,4,Un excellent petit bar √† vin avec que des bons produits et un service chaleureux !
Exces,1.0,1,1,1,1,"We made an online booking on the website. We were very excited to have a romantic evening. The booking was confirmed. When we arrived there under a heavy rain, the restaurant was‚Ä¶closed üò°. Just like that ‚Ä¶"
Exces,5.0,5,5,5,5,Nice little wine bar cozy atmosphere. Amazing shared platter
CITRUS,5.0,5,5,5,5,The ‚Äò23-‚Äò24 New Year‚Äôs menu was one of the best meals I‚Äôve ever had. Out of this world.  Thank you for an amazing experience!  I‚Äôll be dreaming of that Lobster Thermidor for months! ‚ù§Ô∏è
CITRUS,1.0,1,2,2,1,"Food very uninspiring. They are trying to be a special restaurant but the starters and deserts were of a particularly poor standard. Atmosphere bad, service not attentive and the outside area was the only area filled however they had closed the doors on a hot evening which made it very stuffy and claustrophobic."
CITRUS,3.0,3,2,1,5,"We went to Citrus just a few months ago and it was absolutely perfect. Service was wonderful, the food was amazing and we loved it so much we booked it again so our kids could try it as well. We ordered drinks, sparkling water and cocktails. The cocktails came out right away but the sparkling water didn‚Äôt arrive until we asked twice (after our appetizers arrived). I was recommended the cauliflower dish, for $29 euros. It was so mushy and over cooked that I couldn‚Äôt eat it. The kids ordered the chicken and it was fine, not great, but fine. We also waited our entire meal to order a second cocktail and the waiter never came back to take our order: we would have had at least one more round of drinks but the waiter came to our table 3 times our entire two hour visit. We were so disappointed, especially since we had such a spectacular visit just two months ago."
CITRUS,5.0,5,5,5,5,Love this place and the staff is great! ! 5 stars
CITRUS,3.0,3,3,2,2,"Despite the fact that I made a reservation a month ago, they ‚Ä¢created‚Ä¢ a table for us in the midst of their service aisle. Completely unacceptable as my son was constantly bumped by servers delivering food to other tables. They were clearly overbooked as multiple tables seemed unhappy and were moved. As one 4 top was moved outside, we were given their table. Musical chairs? Never should have happened with reservations. No apologies; no accommodations. Treated us like we were lucky to have a table at all.  After all that, the food was just ok."
CITRUS,4.0,4,5,1,5,Food was good but service/staff not very friendly.
CITRUS,5.0,5,3,3,4,Vegetarian selection was very disappointing but food is beautiful and delicious. Please add vegetarian entr√©e option.
CITRUS,5.0,5,5,5,5,My husband and I stumbled upon Citrus on a Friday night after arriving in Paris. What a treat! The food was absolutely wonderful and the 2 and 3 course options were very reasonably priced especially considering how delicious the food was! The servers were all very nice and worked so hard to make it a wonderful dining experience. We enjoyed it so much that we are going back before we leave Paris!
CITRUS,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The experience was wonderful, especially after a day of walking through Paris!!"
CITRUS,5.0,5,5,5,5,Amazing food and exceptional service..I would recommend the scallops and prawns and duck breast and sweet potato!

CITRUS,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Nice ambience, very attentive staff and the food was quite good. Happy to discover it."
CITRUS,4.0,4,5,4,5,"Excellent food in a relaxed environment. The fois gras is to die for. There is also a great wine list. The only small issue we had was that none of the desserts were to our liking. Otherwise, it was a great experience."
CITRUS,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Great place. The food is excellent, perhaps the desserts were a little disappointing but still good. Service is very attentive and kind, always willing to help and make recommendations"

CITRUS,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Our experience at Citrus was simply wonderful. Our appetizers, entrees, desserts and drinks were all phenomenal. Staff were very friendly and it was such a pleasant and memorable evening for us in Paris. We will definitely visit Citrus again on our next trips to Paris."

CITRUS,5.0,5,5,2,5,"The food was amazing, we had a good time. The ambience was nice the server wasn‚Äôt so friendly but it might have been a language"
CITRUS,5.0,5,5,5,5,"For a newer restaurant - they are doing it right! The ‚Äúteam service‚Äù was exceptional and the food superb. When they ran out of figs for my dessert - they gave it to me but deducted from the bill because they were not happy with it. Great 3 course meal value for Paris!
Will be top rated very soon!!!!"
CITRUS,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Wonderful ambience in the evening fantastic food and value and the service was lovely!

CITRUS,5.0,5,5,5,5,Hands down the best meal we have had in Paris so far. Every dish was perfectly prepared. Service was top notch. Great vibe to the place- we sat in the outside area in the back. I‚Äôd go back again just for the mushroom and polenta appetizer. Outstanding.

CITRUS,5.0,5,5,5,5,We had a lovely dinner. I had burratina and sea bream. I can‚Äôt remember what my friend had but we did get three desserts. Service was good and we sat outside in a back terrace/garden. The only drawback is that I was hoping to go back with friends after they arrive tomorrow but it is closing for vacation. Definitely recommend but definitely book ahead.

New Dehli Indien,1.0,1,1,2,2,"Worst Indian restaurant I've been to (I've been to dozens, I'm Indian and have had Indian food my whole life). Flavors were oddly spiced, sweet rather than savory, item we received was wrong (received chicken instead of lamb), food was a poor value. Would never eat here again. Service was average. Interior was dark--not in a good way."

Nectar,3.0,3,3,2,3,"Overall a nice tasting menu with ambition in an informal setting.
The service could be brushed up on - they couldn‚Äôt find our reservation and then brought us the wrong menu twice.
Also had annoying 80s music playing which was turned up much too loud.  - ambience music only please for a tasting music."
Nectar,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Loved it, great service, great food. Friendly. Definitely recommend"
Mersea Beaupassage,5.0,5,5,5,5,Food was delicious. Drinks were great. Service was attentive. Must eat here when visiting Paris.
Mersea Beaupassage,1.0,1,1,1,1,"The restaurant is not open on sundays.  I don‚Äôt understand why open table or MERSEA would make a reservation knowing this.
Very disappointing on both your parts."
Mersea Beaupassage,1.0,1,1,1,1,we had a booking for 31/12/22 at 10 pm (4 children and 2 adults) and arrived to find out the restaraunt was closed at 3 pm- one staff member was there who was not able to explain how this happened
Mersea Beaupassage,1.0,1,1,1,1,"Had to find another Restaurant after we found out that they were closed at new years eve, eben though that we had a confirmed reservation for this time. Quite challenging in Paris at 7 pm. Consequently, I can not recommend this place."
Mersea Beaupassage,1.0,1,2,2,1,"50 percent of the Food was Not available, Booking was Not prepared, no Good Service, OpenTable was Not Even known, will Never Go there again 
Ist also Raines Form the ceiling"
Mersea Beaupassage,3.0,3,3,4,3,Very little seafood for a seafood restaurant. Only oysters and fish-n-chips. Overall not a place to which I‚Äôd return.

Yacatan Paris,1.0,1,4,1,4,"Was really looking forward to this reservation as it was a really special occasion for us and we had travelled from the UK to be in Paris for NYE to surprise my brother in law. When we arrived on NYE, we were first told we didn‚Äôt have a reservation and then when we showed them this booking, were sat on a table which was clearly not a dining table which felt a bit strange and like we were trying to be made to feel unwelcome. A menu was brought to us, and before saying anything else, the server pointed to the ‚Äò‚Ç¨200 pp‚Äô notice at the top. This price a TOTAL surprise to us, and when we asked if there was the usual menu which we‚Äôd seen online, we were told there was only one menu as it was NYE. 

We had not been informed that this was the case prior to our booking and I had received multiple emails in the run up to the booking which would have been a perfect time to mention it surely? Nothing had mentioned it on their website either.

Online in other reviews it states that the usual dining experience is around ‚Ç¨50pp and had we have been informed that it was ‚Ç¨200 each on NYE, we wouldn‚Äôt have booked it and wasted our time. 

Just seemed like they didn‚Äôt want us in the restaurant and clearly didn‚Äôt have space/had overbooked. Can‚Äôt comment on the food as we left before we ate, only then to have to find somewhere else to eat at 7pm on NYE (nightmare!) Luckily, after wandering for a while we eventually found a lovely restaurant which was a quarter of the price and incredible food and service. So glad we didn‚Äôt dine at Yacatan after this rude reception. 

Although the interior looked incredible and I‚Äôm sure the food is great (should be for this price!), the vibe was cold and obnoxious. Not the warm, hospitable atmosphere we‚Äôd received every other place we‚Äôd visited in Paris. So disappointing! Definitely check before you dine so you aren‚Äôt caught out like we were."
Yacatan Paris,1.0,1,1,1,1,"The ladies who check you in are prejudice. I have no words. Horrible experience, horrible!"
Villa Yora,5.0,5,5,5,5,We had a great time at Villa Mikuna. Great food and friendly staff!
Villa Yora,5.0,5,5,5,5,So happy we found this place. The food was absolutely amazing. The staff was friendly. And they even had live music which we didn‚Äôt expect. We went to celebrate a birthday and it turned out to be the perfect place to have a festive and delicious celebratory meal! Will definitely be back.
Villa Yora,4.0,4,5,5,5,"Plats savoureux tres √©labor√©s

Villa Yora,5.0,5,5,5,5,One of the best food we had in Paris!
Villa Yora,3.0,3,3,4,4,Good for couples and friends but if you have kids then it is not the place since the menu is limited
Villa Yora,5.0,5,5,5,5,Fantastic seafood dishes - great chefs and service!! Highly recommended
Villa Yora,3.0,3,1,5,4,"Desgraci√°damente mi novia se enferm√≥ del est√≥mago despu√©s de comer un ceviche de pescado aqu√≠ y eso le arruin√≥ dos d√≠as del viaje por Par√≠s, muy agradable el lugar pero jo pueden permitirse servir pescado en mal estado, qu√© pena."
Villa Yora,3.0,3,3,2,2,No manager on Duty
Villa Yora,5.0,5,4,5,5,"It was busy for a Sunday night and 1 waiter. However, he was efficient and pleasant. The classic ceviche was very good and the Lomo Saltado was very tasty. My only critique was the Arroz con Leche, I felt the rice could have been cooked longer as it was a bit hard. Overall, it was an enjoyable dinner!"
Villa Yora,4.0,4,5,3,4,Great food and setting. I would have rated higher but we were rudely rushed out when it got late.
La Bauhinia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Went here for my husband's 60th birthday while we were vacationing with our kids in Paris. The food is wondering and you can't beat the view of the Eiffel Tower. Be sure to ask for patio seating though, if the weather is appropriate. My only complaint is that there were quite a few smokers sitting nearby, but it was for the most part, fine. Highly recommend coming here for a special occasion."
La Bauhinia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Absolutely exquisite. We came for champagne and caviar and enjoyed the beautiful ambiance and decor. The staff was professional and friendly. It was a fantastic birthday! Thank you!
La Bauhinia,5.0,5,5,5,5,INCREDIBLE
La Bauhinia,4.0,4,3,5,5,"The staff is attentive, and the ambiance is beautiful...

For vegetarian preparations, however, the taste is average - the vegetarian option could have more heat, and flavor. The server informed us that the Pad Thai could not be made spicier. That was disappointing to hear."
La Bauhinia,2.0,2,1,3,3,Super overpriced for what the food is. We were beyond disappointed as it was our last meal in Paris before we flew home. 218 bucks for cheap tasting noodles you can get at any Chinese place and fish that basically just had hollandaise on it.
La Bauhinia,1.0,1,2,1,4,The service was not good at all and the food overprice for its quality
La Bauhinia,5.0,5,5,5,5,We loved the food and the politeness of the workers. The atmosphere is really classy.
La Bauhinia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Our server was lovely and the food delicious. Nice, quiet ambiance in a luxury hotel."
La Bauhinia,2.0,2,4,1,3,"My young daughter and I were in Paris to celebrate her birthday and I organised many lovely meals in the finest restaurants, this being one of them. When we arrived the male server assumed we were visiting with a pre paid ‚Äúdeal‚Äù which the glass of champagne I had ordered wasn‚Äôt a part of. I had to explain I had not made this kind of reservation. 

The service went from bad to worse. A sprite took 45 mins to arrive, and a second glass of champagne took so long that after having taken more than two hours to have lunch, I had to cancel the glass. How does it take 40 mins to bring a glass of champagne? 

Such a shame. The garden is beautiful but the service here leaves A LOT to be desired."
La Bauhinia,5.0,5,5,5,5,This was our 5th Anniversary and first time in Paris. The server was very very sweet and the girl manager too. The food is sooooo delicious that I didn‚Äôt ever wanna leave. This restaurant is a 10/10. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone and everyone who is celebrating a special day.
La Bauhinia,5.0,5,5,5,5,Hermoso lugar y atenci√≥n la pasamos incre√≠ble
La Bauhinia,5.0,5,4,5,5,"Awesome food, beautiful restaurant and decor, service is without fault"
La Bauhinia,5.0,5,5,5,5,"Visited for my girlfriends 30th birthday.

Food was amazing and the service outstanding. They even provided us with a selection of cakes for her birthday with a candle and birthday message! Would recommend highly to go back"
La Bauhinia,4.0,4,5,4,5,Excellent food and beautiful place! Only thing is that we had to ask the waiter a few times to get wine and water refills.
La Bauhinia,2.0,2,2,4,3,The food was not up to par for this caliber restaurant. Very disappointed!
La Bauhinia,5.0,5,5,5,4,Anniversary
BON,1.0,1,2,1,1,Worst experience we had in Paris and would not recommend this restaurant.  Food was just ok but the owner ruined our NYE.  We were charged $400 for 4 children who did not eat dinner after being told at the beginning of dinner we were NOT going to be charged.  They were looking to scam foreigners from the US.  Stay away from this place.  We were sat in the back of the place and with horrible seating/furniture.  Horrible experience and not kid friendly.  Take your money somewhere else.
BON,3.0,3,3,5,5,"The food here was good and the venue is very very nice. I do not believe the food was worth the price and for wine the cost was pretty high even for the lowest cost bottles, there is plenty of good wine for a fraction of the cost that restaurant and the food was good as I said just not worth the high prices. You can get better food and wine for a small fraction of those prices elsewhere. Staff and venue were 10/10"
BON,3.0,3,2,4,3,La comida y el lugar dej√≥ mucho que desear. La persona que nos atendi√≥ muy amable
BON,4.0,4,4,4,5,NYE dinner for our family of 5. It was a set menu but plenty of options. Japanese Asian inspired. Food was delicious.
BON,2.0,2,3,1,4,"We had the New Year tasting menu and had a terrible experience. One of the appetizers was bland, so we requested a change. The server agreed and took the plate, then returned and placed the plate BACK on the table, stating the kitchen refused the return. He spoke to the manager, who also refused. The order was finally changed when we insisted we speak to the manager, though he never came out. The service was incredibly slow, taking 3 hours for a pre-set menu for 3 people. The steak was way overcooked (medium well for a medium rare order). We also heard the table next door complain of the same thing. We were hesitant to send it back based on our experience with the apps. The only positive comment was that 2/3 entrees were good and the dessert was excellent. I'm not sure it was worth sitting for an extra hour to order them, though. Poor service, inconsistent and bland food, is not worth the price."
BON,1.0,1,1,2,1,"This has to be the worst food I‚Äôve ever eaten in Paris. The staff was nice but slow and our main server had dirty finger nails. As far as the food, I couldn‚Äôt taste any alcohol in my martini, the ‚Äúdumplings‚Äù disintegrated at the touch and became mush that stuck to the plate, and the bed of greens with the main course was wilted and brown. This place is far too expensive for what is third-rate catering food."
BON,5.0,5,5,4,5,Christmas dinner! Food was delicious!
BON,1.0,1,1,1,3,Horrible service.  Food was blah.  Whole thing feels like it‚Äôs built for instagram not an actual good dining experience .

BON,4.0,4,4,4,5,"The singer and song choices for us were great.. he really tried hard to make everyone enjoy the evening and almost personally sang to every table whilst putting on a show. Defo made the evening better!
Food was good too, not quite 5 star but was still very nice"

BON,5.0,5,5,5,4,"Amazing celebratory dinner.  Great fresh food, especially wonton soup. Fun, live music.  The BEST service in Paris! 
This is a must try restaurant!"
BON,3.0,3,3,4,4,"Lovely restaurant with good service, albeit a bit hectic. Food good but severely overpriced. None of the extras (amuse bouche/petit fours etc you would expect at this price level. Restaurant while beautifully designed could use touchups here and there."
BON,4.0,4,4,4,4,"Nice restaurant, big portions."
BON,5.0,5,5,5,5,We are visiting from the US and this was our favorite restaurant we have been to in Paris so far! We were looking for something different from French food and the Asian fusion was to die for! It‚Äôs definitely a hot spot and the food was so good!!

BON,5.0,5,5,5,5,Good service and excellent foodüëç
L'Orange Verte,1.0,1,1,1,1,"We arrived and weren‚Äôt greeted until 10-15 minutes later (with a reservation) and were given a two seat table in a very inaccessible area. I wrote a request in open table asking for two glasses of champagne upon arrival, this did not happen. I then asked for a glass of champagne to sip on while we waited another 15 minutes for a table and I was handed a Riesling in a champagne flute‚Ä¶ the table beside us was seated TWICE and both parties walked out after not being greeted or offered beverages. It looks like it could be a really cool place and the entrees looked good around us but we didn‚Äôt have the chance to try anything."
6six,1.0,1,1,1,1,We arrived at the restaurant to find a sign saying it was closed for construction and renovation. So it was not a good start for my birthday dinner. Not impressed.
Paillettes,1.0,1,3,3,3,I booked my reservation same-day using OT and when I arrived they told me they could not accommodate my reservation and turned me away because they were full.
Paillettes,4.0,4,5,4,5,"Beautiful food, great atmosphere"
Paillettes,2.0,2,4,1,3,"I had to be in Paris over the weekend and booked this restaurant as a solo diner. The front of house staff were incredulous that I was a party of one, which was not a super start, they questioned how I had been able to make the booking, and then told me I could only have the table for an hour - I ended up staying beyond that time and was not asked to leave. The waitress was great and the food was delicious but it took forever to arrive (which led to me staying beyond the hour I was told I could have the table for). Basically: don‚Äôt go here as a solo diner."
Paillettes,5.0,5,5,5,5,"We had an incredible experience at Paillettes!! The energy of the second dinner seating on Saturday night was unmatched. Great place to start a night out - great food, great drinks, and great music. The DJ got everyone out of their seats and dancing together! The service was top notch as well, especially from the bartender Orlando and the host Pablo. We loved this place and will definitely return the next time we are in Paris."
Paillettes,5.0,5,5,5,5,"The food was great.  We had the poulpe with sweet potato and the vegetarian salad, plus hummus and another spread.  It was all fantastic.  The restaurant is charming looking with exposed stone walls and reddish orange chairs.  We were there on a Tuesday night so the sound level was good, but I understand they play music on weekends, so maybe it is louder then.  We would definitely go back."
Paillettes,5.0,5,5,5,5,The staff and the owner was amazing. They were pleasant and sweet. Restaurant is beautiful
Paillettes,5.0,5,5,4,5,Great place!

The food is really incredible th√© mood is crazy."
Paillettes,1.0,1,3,1,2,"There are times when as a diner - you think you may have stumbled on something good that no one else knows about. We booked this restaurant on Open Table and noted it was pretty new but thought the menu was interesting. 

Anyway we arrive and realise something was a bit odd. There was a singer - dj and guitarist but no guests. We were not sure of our decision but we‚Äôre taken to our table after some confusion. After a while we discover this is their first night - although we were made to feel like intruders not welcomed at all. We ordered hoping the welcome and the random ambience would improve (music volume was so loud we asked for it to be reduced twice). Our waiter was distracted and not on it. Remember we were the only people in the restaurant at the time. We ordered the lamb ( great but not warm enough). Then our deserts came - and life became more surreal . My desert looked good and tasted ok until I discover the remains of a plastic sachet in the food ! We complained and the owner came a few minutes later and said the chef apologised‚Ä¶a sort of partial apology. They offered to remove the desert cost from our bill but nothing else ! No free glass of wine nothing. I refused another dish. While my wife was finishing her desert our waiter presented the bill without myself of my wife asking for it. It was a surly action almost trying to get us to leave.

By this stage there were a few more diners in the restaurant- a lady near us had a scarf on her chair - it fell onto the floor. The Maitre De walked past it and left it - I then alerted the grateful guest after he had moved on. 

Finally after this most strange of evenings - we got up to leave. No one came over to talk to us - as we walked out no one said goodbye out of 4 staff we passed ( all of which we has spoken to ). We then tried to leave the restaurant the door would not open ( internal electric ) we waited a couple of minutes for the owner to realise our plight and let us out.

In one word terrible."
